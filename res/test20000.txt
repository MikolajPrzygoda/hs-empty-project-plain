in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the third day
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven
and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold
and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof
and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden
and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou
and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper
and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand
when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle
and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him
male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth
and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos
and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan
and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel
and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he died
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat enoch
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years
and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son
and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord hath cursed
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
in the six hundredth year of noah's life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark
they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained
and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried
and god spake unto noah saying
go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him
every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar
and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man
whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying
and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you
and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations
i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud
and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth overspread
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the city rehoboth and calah
and resen between nineveh and calah the same is a great city
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and caphtorim
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth
and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite
and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite
and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboim even unto lasha
these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud and aram
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brother's name was joktan
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah
and hadoram and uzal and diklah
and obal and abimael and sheba
and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east
these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations
these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do
go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood
and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat salah
and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters
and salah lived thirty years and begat eber
and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters
and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg
and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu
and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters
and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug
and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor
and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah
and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters
and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and haran
now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram nahor and haran and haran begat lot
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abram's wife was sarai and the name of nahor's wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah
but sarai was barren she had no child
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's son and sarai his daughter in law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will shew thee
and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing
and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon
therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh's house
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abram's wife
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai
unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward
for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations
that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emims in shaveh kiriathaim
and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim
with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way
and they took lot abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the king's dale
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth
and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich
save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it
and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years
and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates
the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites
and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims
and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites
now sarai abram's wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai
and sarai abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur
and he said hagar sarai's maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me
wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his son's name which hagar bare ishmael
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram
and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear
and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee
and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abraham's house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground
and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant
let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree
and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also
and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old
is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous
i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein
that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right
and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for forty's sake
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twenty's sake
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for ten's sake
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground
and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servant's house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter
and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him
and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place
for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord
behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord
and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a man's wife
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing
and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my father's house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abraham's wife
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac
and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest
now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my son's son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned
and abraham said i will swear
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelech's servants had violently taken away
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves
and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time
and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son
that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba
and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor
huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram
and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor abraham's brother
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying
i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar
that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying
nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him
my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest
and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again
the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in
and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my master's brethren
and the damsel ran and told them of her mother's house these things
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on
and he said i am abraham's servant
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses
and sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my father's house
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink
and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my master's son
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahor's son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy master's son's wife as the lord hath spoken
and it came to pass that when abraham's servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master
and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abraham's servant and his men
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done
and isaac brought her into his mother sarah's tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mother's death
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country
and these are the days of the years of abraham's life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre
the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi
now these are the generations of ishmael abraham's son whom hagar the egyptian sarah's handmaid bare unto abraham
and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam
and mishma and dumah and massa
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah
these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren
and these are the generations of isaac abraham's son abraham begat isaac
and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived
and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esau's heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but rebekah loved jacob
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint
and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me
and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his birthright
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of
sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
and isaac dwelt in gerar
and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she was fair to look upon
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great
for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines envied him
for all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them
and isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaac's herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land
and he went up from thence to beersheba
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham's sake
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaac's servants digged a well
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you
and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee
that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace
and it came to pass the same day that isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite
which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death
now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison
and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying
bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth
and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man
my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son
and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of esau
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esau's hands so he blessed him
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my son's venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine
let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting
and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his son's venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me
and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son
and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above
and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee
now therefore my son obey my voice and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran
and tarry with him a few days until thy brother's fury turn away
until thy brother's anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day
and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me
and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mother's father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mother's brother
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people
and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacob's and esau's mother
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram
and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father
then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham's son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on
so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god
and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the well's mouth
and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they said of haran are we
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth then we water the sheep
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her father's sheep for she kept them
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mother's brother and the sheep of laban his mother's brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of laban his mother's brother
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept
and jacob told rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was rebekah's son and she ran and told her father
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be
and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard that i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die
and jacob's anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in god's stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan
and bilhah rachel's maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife
and zilpah leah's maid bare jacob a son
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad
and zilpah leah's maid bare jacob a second son
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy son's mandrakes
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my son's mandrakes and he lay with her that night
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach
and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of laban's flocks
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto laban's cattle
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were laban's and the stronger jacob's
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses
and he heard the words of laban's sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our father's and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock
and said unto them i see your father's countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house
are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our children's now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her father's
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount gilead
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy father's house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods
and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them
and laban went into jacob's tent and into leah's tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leah's tent and entered into rachel's tent
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel's furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed
and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee
this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him
and when jacob saw them he said this is god's host and he called the name of that place mahanaim
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now
and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands
and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother
two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee
then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacob's it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechem's father for an hundred pieces of money
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacob's daughter which thing ought not to be done
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised
then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone
and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamor's son
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacob's daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying
these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city
and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinah's brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechem's house and went out
the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister
they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field
and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house
and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house
and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot
and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother
then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments
and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went
and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem
and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob
so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is bethel he and all the people that were with him
and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother
but deborah rebekah's nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth
and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him
and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel
and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins
and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel
and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour
and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also
and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name benoni but his father called him benjamin
and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is bethlehem
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of rachel's grave unto this day
and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar
and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his father's concubine and israel heard it now the sons of jacob were twelve
the sons of leah reuben jacob's firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun
the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin
and the sons of bilhah rachel's handmaid dan and naphtali
and the sons of zilpah leah's handmaid gad and asher these are the sons of jacob which were born to him in padanaram
and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre unto the city of arbah which is hebron where abraham and isaac sojourned
and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years
and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried him
now these are the generations of esau who is edom
esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and aholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite

and adah bare to esau eliphaz and bashemath bare reuel

and esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the persons of his house and his cattle and all his beasts and all his substance which he had got in the land of canaan and went into the country from the face of his brother jacob
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle

and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan
these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his father's wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him
and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more
and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed
for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf
and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words
and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me
and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth
and his brethren envied him but his father observed the saying
and his brethren went to feed their father's flock in shechem
and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i
and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem
and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou
and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed their flocks
and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan
and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him
and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh
come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams
and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him
and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again
and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that was on him
and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it
and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt
and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood
come and let us sell him to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content
then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt
and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes
and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and i whither shall i go
and they took joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood
and they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy son's coat or no
and he knew it and said it is my son's coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces
and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaoh's and captain of the guard
and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shuah and he took her and went in unto her
and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er
and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan
and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar
and er judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him
and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother
and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him also
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy father's house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her father's house
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite
and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep
and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife
when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her face
and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me
and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it
and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand but he found her not
then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this place
and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place
and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her
and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt
when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff
and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more
and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb
and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first
and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez
and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zarah
and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither
and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian
and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand
and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptian's house for joseph's sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field
and he left all that he had in joseph's hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favoured
and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me
but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand
there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god
and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her
and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within
and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out
and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth
that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice
and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out
and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home
and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me
and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out
and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled
and joseph's master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison
but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper
and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward
and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the prison
and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad
and he asked pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day
and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them i pray you
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me
and in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes
and pharaoh's cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaoh's cup and i gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three white baskets on my head
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head
and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee
and it came to pass the third day which was pharaoh's birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke
and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day
pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret
and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it
and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good
and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do
the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants
and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is
and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art
thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou
and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt
and pharaoh called joseph's name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house
and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction
and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended
and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread
and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all lands
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another
and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die
and joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt
but benjamin joseph's brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan
and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and joseph's brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth
and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food
and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come
we are all one man's sons we are true men thy servants are no spies
and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not
and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies
hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither
send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies
and he put them all together into ward three days
and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god
if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses
but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so
and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us
and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required
and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter
and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every man's money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them
and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sack's mouth
and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying
the man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country
and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies
we be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan
and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone
and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid
and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me
and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again
and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
and the famine was sore in the land
and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food
and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food
but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother
and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down
and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever
for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time
and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds
and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight
take also your brother and arise go again unto the man
and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved
and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph
and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon
and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into joseph's house
and the men were afraid because they were brought into joseph's house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses
and they came near to the steward of joseph's house and they communed with him at the door of the house
and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food
and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every man's money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks
and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them
and the man brought the men into joseph's house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth
and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive
and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance
and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son
and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there
and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread
and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians
and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one at another
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him
and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in his sack's mouth
and put my cup the silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses
and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing
and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words
and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lord's bondmen
and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack
and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamin's sack
then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city
and judah and his brethren came to joseph's house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground
and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine
and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lord's servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found
and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father
then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lord's ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh
my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother
and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him
and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord
and our father said go again and buy us a little food
and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the man's face except our youngest brother be with us
and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons
and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since
and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life
it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever
now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren
for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father
then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren
and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard
and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence
and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life
for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance
so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast
and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither
and he fell upon his brother benjamin's neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck
moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh's house saying joseph's brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants
and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan
and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land
now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come
also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours
and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment
and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way
so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way
and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father
and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not
and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived
and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die
and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i
and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation
i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes
and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him
and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him
his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt
and these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacob's firstborn
and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and carmi

and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into egypt were threescore and ten
and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen
and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while
and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive
and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father's house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my father's house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me
and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation
that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians
then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen
and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathers
they said moreover unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee
the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou
and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage
and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh
and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded
and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his father's household with bread according to their families
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaoh's house
and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth
and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail
and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaoh's
and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof
only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands
then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land
and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones
and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaoh's servants
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not pharaoh's
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt
but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said
and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the bed's head
and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim
and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed
and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me
and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession
and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine
and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same is bethlehem
and israel beheld joseph's sons and said who are these
and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them
and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israel's left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israel's right hand and brought them near unto him
and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraim's head who was the younger and his left hand upon manasseh's head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn
and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day
the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his father's hand to remove it from ephraim's head unto manasseh's head
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head
and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations
and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh
and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow
and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days
gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father
reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power
unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch
simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel
judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee
judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up
the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be
binding his foal unto the vine and his ass's colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes
his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute
dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel
dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward
i have waited for thy salvation o lord
gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last
out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties
naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words
joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall
the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him
but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of israel
even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the womb
the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them
and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite
in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people
and joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel
and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days
and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying
my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again
and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear
and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt
and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his father's house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days
and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which is beyond jordan
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre
and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father
and when joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him
and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying
so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants
and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god
but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive
now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them
and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his father's house and joseph lived an hundred and ten years
and joseph saw ephraim's children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon joseph's knees
and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence
so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt
now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob
reuben simeon levi and judah
issachar zebulun and benjamin
dan and naphtali gad and asher
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls for joseph was in egypt already
and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation
and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them
now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph
and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we
come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and raamses
but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah
and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live
but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive
and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive
and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them
therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty
and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses
and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive
and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi
and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months
and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink
and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him
and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the river's side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it
and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children
then said his sister to pharaoh's daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee
and pharaoh's daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the child's mother
and pharaoh's daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it
and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said because i drew him out of the water
and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren
and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand
and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow
and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing is known
now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well
now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock
and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock
and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon to day
and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock
and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread
and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter
and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land
and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage
and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob
and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them
now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed
and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt
and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i
and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god
and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows
and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites
now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them
come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt
and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt
and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain
and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them
and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you
and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations
go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt
and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey
and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand
and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians
and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee
and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod
and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it
and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand
that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee
and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow
and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land
and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue
and the lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the lord
now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say
and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send
and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart
and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of god
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signs
and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace
and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life
and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand
and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn
and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn
and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and sought to kill him
then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art thou to me
so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art because of the circumcision
and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel
and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people
and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped
and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go
and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword
and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens
and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens
and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves
and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god
let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard vain words
and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw
go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your work shall be diminished
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw
and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your daily tasks as when there was straw
and the officers of the children of israel which pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day as heretofore
then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants
there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people
but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and do sacrifice to the lord
go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks
and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task
and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh
and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us
and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all
then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land
and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord
and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them
and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers
and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant
wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments
and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians
and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for an heritage i am the lord
and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage
and the lord spake unto moses saying
go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land
and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt
these be the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these be the families of reuben
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon
and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the life of levi were an hundred thirty and seven years
the sons of gershon libni and shimi according to their families
and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel and the years of the life of kohath were an hundred thirty and three years
and the sons of merari mahali and mushi these are the families of levi according to their generations
and amram took him jochebed his father's sister to wife and she bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years
and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri
and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and zithri
and aaron took him elisheba daughter of amminadab sister of naashon to wife and she bare him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korhites
and eleazar aaron's son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families
these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their armies
these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron
and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in the land of egypt
that the lord spake unto moses saying i am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee
and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me
and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet
thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land
and i will harden pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they
and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto pharaoh
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent
then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments
for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aaron's rod swallowed up their rods
and he hardened pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh's heart is hardened he refuseth to let the people go
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand
and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear
thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood
and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood
and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaoh's heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said
and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set his heart to this also
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river
and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten the river
and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs
and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord
and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river only
and he said to morrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god
and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh
and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields
and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt
and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast
then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaoh's heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth
and i will put a division between my people and thy people to morrow shall this sign be
and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land
and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will they not stone us
we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us
and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away intreat for me
and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord
and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one
and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would he let the people go
then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still
behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of israel
and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land
and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one
and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people go
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt
and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth
for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go
behold to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now
send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die
he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field
and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt
and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt
so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation
and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field
only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail
and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked
intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer
and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how that the earth is the lord's
but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god
and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was bolled
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown up
and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses
and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew these my signs before him
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son's son what things i have wrought in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i am the lord
and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast
and they shall cover the face of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field
and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out from pharaoh
and pharaoh's servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed
and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go
and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the lord
and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you
not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye did desire and they were driven out from pharaoh's presence
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left
and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts
and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such
for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you
now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death only
and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the coasts of egypt
but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days
they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings
and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you
and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god
our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither
but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart and he would not let them go
and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die
and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again no more
and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether
speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of gold
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people
and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more
but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt
and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go out of his land
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house
and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb
your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening
and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it
and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done of you
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever
in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land
ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread
then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the passover
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever
and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service
and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service
that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lord's passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped
and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle
and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead
and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said
also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men
and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the egyptians
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children
and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual
now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of the lord went out from the land of egypt
it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations
and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof
but every man's servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof
in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof
all the congregation of israel shall keep it
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof
one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you
thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies
and the lord spake unto moses saying
sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine
and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten
this day came ye out in the month abib
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the lord's law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lord's
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage
and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children i redeem
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt
and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt
but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt
and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you
and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness
and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall ye encamp by the sea
for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in
and i will harden pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so
and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us
and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him
and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with an high hand
but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon
and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord
and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt
is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness
and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no more for ever
the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace
and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward
but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea
and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them
and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night
and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided
and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen
and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians
and took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen
and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea
and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them
but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore
and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my father's god and i will exalt him
the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea
the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone
thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea
the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them
thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters
who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders
thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation
the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina
then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away
fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased
thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established
the lord shall reign for ever and ever
for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea
and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances
and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water
and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah
and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink
and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them
and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee
and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters
and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness
and the children of israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger
then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no
and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt
and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against us
and moses said this shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the lord
and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your murmurings
and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud
and the lord spake unto moses saying
i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your god
and it came to pass that at even the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host
and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar frost on the ground
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses said unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of it every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tents
and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less
and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating
and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses was wroth with them
and they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted
and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses
and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said to morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning
and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not stink neither was there any worm therein
and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field
six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the sabbath in it there shall be none
and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none
and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
see for that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day
so the people rested on the seventh day
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt
and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations
as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept
and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink
wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the lord
and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst
and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me
and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thine hand and go
behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel
and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not
then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim
and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand
so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed
but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword
and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven
and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovahnissi
for he said because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation
when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt
then jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back
and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been an alien in a strange land
and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh
and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god
and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her
and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent
and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel's sake and all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians
and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians
now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them
and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening
and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even
and moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to enquire of god
when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws
and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good
thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone
hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god shall be with thee be thou for the people to godward that thou mayest bring the causes unto god
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens
and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee
if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their place in peace
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said
and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens
and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves
and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own land
in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai
for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount
and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel
ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself
now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel
and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him
and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes
and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death
there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount
and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothes
and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the nether part of the mount
and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice
and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses went up
and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish
and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them
and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it
and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them
so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them
and god spake all these words saying
i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
thou shalt have no other gods before me
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
remember the sabbath day to keep it holy
six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not commit adultery
thou shalt not steal
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbour's
and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off
and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die
and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin not
and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was
and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven
ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee and i will bless thee
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them
if thou buy an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing

if his master have given him a wife and she have born him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her master's and he shall go out by himself

if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep and it die or be hurt or driven away no man seeing it

and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron
and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord
and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play
and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation
and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people
remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written
and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp
and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear
and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount
and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it
and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them
and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief
for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf
and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies
then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him
and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour
and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin
and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold
yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written
and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book
therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them
and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf which aaron made
and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it
and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite
unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way
and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments
for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb
and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp
and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle
and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent door
and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle
and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight
now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people
and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest
and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth
and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name
and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory
and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy
and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live
and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock
and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by
and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen
and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest
and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone
and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord
and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth
keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation
and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped
and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance
and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee
observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee
but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves
for thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods
thou shalt make thee no molten gods
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt
all that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty
six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the year's end
thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the lord god the god of israel
for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk
and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel
and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments
and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him
and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai
and till moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face
but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he took the vail off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded
and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face shone and moses put the vail upon his face again until he went in to speak with him
and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath commanded that ye should do them
six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying

and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood before the lord
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye should do and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you
and moses said unto aaron go unto the altar and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them as the lord commanded
aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himself
and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar
but the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as the lord commanded moses
and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp
and he slew the burnt offering and aaron's sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altar
and they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar
and he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar
and he brought the people's offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the first
and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the manner
and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people and aaron's sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver
and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altar
and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded
and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people
and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces
and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not
and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord
then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace
and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp
so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as moses had said
and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you and they did according to the word of moses
and the lord spake unto aaron saying
do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean
and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses
and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy
and ye shall eat it in the holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire for so i am commanded
and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel
the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a statute for ever as the lord hath commanded
and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron which were left alive saying
wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the lord
behold the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as i commanded
and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord
and when moses heard that he was content
and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them
speak unto the children of israel saying these are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth
whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the cud among the beasts that shall ye eat

they shall be even an abomination unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh but ye shall have their carcases in abomination
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters that shall be an abomination unto you
and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls they shall not be eaten they are an abomination the eagle and the ossifrage and the ospray

yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four which have legs above their feet to leap withal upon the earth
even these of them ye may eat the locust after his kind and the bald locust after his kind and the beetle after his kind and the grasshopper after his kind
but all other flying creeping things which have four feet shall be an abomination unto you
and for these ye shall be unclean whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even

this is the law of the beasts and of the fowl and of every living creature that moveth in the waters and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel saying if a woman have conceived seed and born a man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised
and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled

what man soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people

and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people
for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul
therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood
and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust
for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off
and every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean

and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed
for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand ye shall not oppress one another
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee
ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear thy godfor i am the lord your god
wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety
and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety
and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase
then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years
and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store
the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land
if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold
and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it
then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession
but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubile
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile
notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time
and if a man purchase of the levites then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of jubile for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession
and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee
take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy god that thy brother may live with thee
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy victuals for increase
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile
and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return
for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen
thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy god
both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule one over another with rigour
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the stranger's family
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him
either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself
and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him
if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile then he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight
and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of jubile both he and his children with him
for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up a standing image neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god
ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord
if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them
then i will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely
and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will rid evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land
and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword
and five of you shall chase an hundred and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword
for i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you
and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new
and i will set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you
and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be my people
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright
but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments
and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments but that ye break my covenant
i also will do this unto you i will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it
and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins
and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass
and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits
and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins
i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your high ways shall be desolate
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will walk contrary unto me
then will i also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy
and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat
and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul shall abhor you
and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours
and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it
and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it
and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursueth
and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies
and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them
if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me
and that i also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity
then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land
the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes
and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god
but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord
these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation

and if it be from sixty years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels
but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him
and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy
he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy
and if it be any unclean beast of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the lord then he shall present the beast before the priest
and the priest shall value it whether it be good or bad as thou valuest it who art the priest so shall it be
but if he will at all redeem it then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the lord then the priest shall estimate it whether it be good or bad as the priest shall estimate it so shall it stand
and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be his
and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord some part of a field of his possession then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile according to thy estimation it shall stand
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain even unto the year of the jubile and it shall be abated from thy estimation
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be assured to him
and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more
but the field when it goeth out in the jubile shall be holy unto the lord as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priest's
and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought which is not of the fields of his possession
then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation even unto the year of the jubile and he shall give thine estimation in that day as a holy thing unto the lord
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel
only the firstling of the beasts which should be the lord's firstling no man shall sanctify it whether it be ox or sheep it is the lord's
and if it be of an unclean beast then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation and shall add a fifth part of it thereto or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to thy estimation
notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath both of man and beast and of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy unto the lord
none devoted which shall be devoted of men shall be redeemed but shall surely be put to death
and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the lord's it is holy unto the lord
and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof
and concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock even of whatsoever passeth under the rod the tenth shall be holy unto the lord
he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it and if he change it at all then both it and the change thereof shall be holy it shall not be redeemed

even those that were numbered of them were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore
according to the commandment of the lord they were numbered by the hand of moses every one according to his service and according to his burden thus were they numbered of him as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead
both male and female shall ye put out without the camp shall ye put them that they defile not their camps in the midst whereof i dwell
and the children of israel did so and put them out without the camp as the lord spake unto moses so did the children of israel
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the lord and that person be guilty
then they shall confess their sin which they have done and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord even to the priest beside the ram of the atonement whereby an atonement shall be made for him
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his
and every man's hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any man's wife go aside and commit a trespass against him
and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled
then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance
and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord and uncover the woman's head and put the offering of memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse
and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen
and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall blot them out with the bitter water
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer it upon the altar
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water
and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot and the woman shall be a curse among her people
and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be free and shall conceive seed
this is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled
or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall set the woman before the lord and the priest shall execute upon her all this law
then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman shall bear her iniquity
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the lord
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow
all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body
he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his god is upon his head
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord
and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head that same day
and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was defiled
and this is the law of the nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and he shall offer his offering unto the lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offerings
and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat offering and their drink offerings
and the priest shall bring them before the lord and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord with the basket of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offering
and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the nazarite after the hair of his separation is shaven
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the lord this is holy for the priest with the wave breast and heave shoulder and after that the nazarite may drink wine
this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed and of his offering unto the lord for his separation beside that that his hand shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after the law of his separation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto aaron and unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel saying unto them
the lord bless thee and keep thee
the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee
the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace
and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them

and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the levites from among the children of israel and cleanse them
and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle water of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together
and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites
and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord
and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement for the levites
and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons and offer them for an offering unto the lord
thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel and the levites shall be mine
and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offering
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me
for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel
and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary

and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
this is it that belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying
let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season
in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it
and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the lord commanded moses so did the children of israel
and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day
and those men said unto him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel
and moses said unto them stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it
but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin
and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning
so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents
at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not
and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed
and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyed
or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed
at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
make thee two trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps
and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto thee
when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward
when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for their journeys
but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm
and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies
also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord your god
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony
and the children of israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran
and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses

and moses said unto hobab the son of raguel the midianite moses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel
and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my kindred
and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes
and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what goodness the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee
and they departed from the mount of the lord three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in the three days journey to search out a resting place for them
and the cloud of the lord was upon them by day when they went out of the camp
and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said rise up lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee
and when it rested he said return o lord unto the many thousands of israel
and when the people complained it displeased the lord and the lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp
and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the lord the fire was quenched
and he called the name of the place taberah because the fire of the lord burnt among them
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat
we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlick
but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this manna before our eyes
and the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium
and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon it
then moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly moses also was displeased
and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me
have i conceived all this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat
i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for me
and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness
and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee
and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone
and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat
ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days
but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt
and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them
and the lord said unto moses is the lord's hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not
and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle
and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease
but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp
and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp
and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them
and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god that all the lord's people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit upon them
and moses gat him into the camp he and the elders of israel
and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a day's journey on this side and as it were a day's journey on the other side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth
and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague
and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted
and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth and abode at hazeroth
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman
and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he not spoken also by us and the lord heard it
now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth
and the lord spake suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out
and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth
and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream
my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house
with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses
and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous
and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned
let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb
and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i beseech thee
and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again
and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again
and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran
and the lord spake unto moses saying
send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a ruler among them
and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of israel
and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur
of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori
of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun
of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu
of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi
of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi
of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli
of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael
of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi
of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi
these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua
and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain
and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many
and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong holds
and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes
so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob as men come to hamath
and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron where ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt
and they came unto the brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs
the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence
and they returned from searching of the land after forty days
and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and shewed them the fruit of the land
and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan
and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it
but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we
and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature
and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight
and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night
and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness
and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt
and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt
then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel
and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes
and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land
if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey
only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel
and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which i have shewed among them
i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they
and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them
and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord art seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying
because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness
and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying
the lord is longsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation
pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now
and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word
but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord
because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice
surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it
but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess it
now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against me
say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me
doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised
but as for you your carcases they shall fall in this wilderness
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land even forty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my breach of promise
i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die
and the men which moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the lord
but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of the men that went to search the land lived still
and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly
and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into the top of the mountain saying lo we be here and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned
and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord but it shall not prosper
go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies
for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the lord therefore the lord will not be with you
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp
then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto hormah
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the land of your habitations which i give unto you
and will make an offering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb
or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the lord
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord
thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kid
according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to every one according to their number
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord
and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the lord
one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land whither i bring you
then it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall ye heave it
of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave offering in your generations
and if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments which the lord hath spoken unto moses
even all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord commanded moses and henceforward among your generations
then it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord with his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner and one kid of the goats for a sin offering
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their ignorance
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignorance
and if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering
and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him
ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people
because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation
and they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to him
and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp
and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue
and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a whoring
that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your god
i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god
now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi and dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took men
and they rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown
and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord
and when moses heard it he fell upon his face
and he spake unto korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him
this do take you censers korah and all his company
and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi
and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi
seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them
and he hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord and what is aaron that ye murmur against him
and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not come up
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up
and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them
and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow
and take every man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and aaron each of you his censer
and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron
and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment
and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram
and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him
and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little children
and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind
if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me
but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord
and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them
and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods
they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation
and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also
and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed
the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel
and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
to be a memorial unto the children of israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near to offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as his company as the lord said to him by the hand of moses
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord
and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared
and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces
and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun
and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people
and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah
and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayed
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every man's name upon his rod
and thou shalt write aaron's name upon the rod of levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you
and it shall come to pass that the man's rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you
and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods
and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness
and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds
and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod
and the lord said unto moses bring aaron's rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not
and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he
and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we die we perish we all perish
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die shall we be consumed with dying
and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness
and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also die
and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel
and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve i have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death
and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever
this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat it it shall be holy unto thee
and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it
all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord them have i given thee
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs
but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord
and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine
all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee
and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel
and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they have no inheritance
but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance
and the lord spake unto moses saying
thus speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lord's heave offering to aaron the priest
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it
therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress
and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel lest ye die
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke
and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face
and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn
and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer
then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days
he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him
this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days
and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel
and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even
but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even
then came the children of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there
and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron
and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord
and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there
and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink
and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink
and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him
and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock
and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them
this is the water of meribah because the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us
how our fathers went down into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our fathers
and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border
let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go by the king's high way we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders
and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come out against thee with the sword
and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet
and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand
thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him
and the children of israel even the whole congregation journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom saying
aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah
take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor
and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there
and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation
and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount
and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they mourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel
and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against israel and took some of them prisoners
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities
and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place hormah
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way
and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread
and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died
therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people
and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live
and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth
and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising
from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared
from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon
and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth upon the border of moab
and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water
then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it
the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the wilderness they went to mattanah
and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth
and from bamoth in the valley that is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying
let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the king's high way until we be past thy borders
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong
and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof
for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto arnon
wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared
for there is a fire gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites
we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites
and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages thereof and drove out the amorites that were there
and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei
and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon
so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive and they possessed his land
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites
and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel
and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time
he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me
come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed
and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak
and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam
and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee
and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying
behold there is a people come out of egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out
and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed
and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you
and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us
and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they
and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me
for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people
and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more
now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more
and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do
and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab
and god's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him
and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way
but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaam's foot against the wall and he smote her again
and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaam's anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staff
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times
and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee
and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay
then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face
and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me
and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive
and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again
and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak
and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in the utmost coast
and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour
and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak
and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth
and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him
and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the people
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram
and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place
and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven altars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram
and the lord put a word in balaam's mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak
and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of moab
and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel
how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied
for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations
who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his
and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether
and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth
and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence
and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder
and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus
and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken
and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor
god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good
behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it
he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them
god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn
surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought
behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain
and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all
but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do
and balak said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence
and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh toward jeshimon
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness
and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
he hath said which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open
how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel
as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the river's side as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters
he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted
god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows
he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee
and balak's anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times
therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour
and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me saying
if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord saith that will i speak
and now behold i go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
he hath said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open
i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of sheth
and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession for his enemies and israel shall do valiantly
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city
and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever
and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock
nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shall carry thee away captive
and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when god doeth this
and ships shall come from the coast of chittim and shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall perish for ever
and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way
and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods
and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel
and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel
and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baalpeor
and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand
and he went after the man of israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand
and the lord spake unto moses saying
phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy
wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace
and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god and made an atonement for the children of israel
now the name of the israelite that was slain even that was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a chief house among the simeonites
and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head over a people and of a chief house in midian
and the lord spake unto moses saying
vex the midianites and smite them
for they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of a prince of midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for peor's sake
and it came to pass after the plague that the lord spake unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying
take the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel from twenty years old and upward throughout their fathers house all that are able to go to war in israel
and moses and eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying

unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit
according to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few
and these are they that were numbered of the levites after their families of gershon the family of the gershonites of kohath the family of the kohathites of merari the family of the merarites
these are the families of the levites the family of the libnites the family of the hebronites the family of the mahlites the family of the mushites the family of the korathites and kohath begat amram
and the name of amram's wife was jochebed the daughter of levi whom her mother bare to levi in egypt and she bare unto amram aaron and moses and miriam their sister
and unto aaron was born nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
and nadab and abihu died when they offered strange fire before the lord
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand all males from a month old and upward for they were not numbered among the children of israel because there was no inheritance given them among the children of israel
these are they that were numbered by moses and eleazar the priest who numbered the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
but among these there was not a man of them whom moses and aaron the priest numbered when they numbered the children of israel in the wilderness of sinai
for the lord had said of them they shall surely die in the wilderness and there was not left a man of them save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
then came the daughters of zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of manasseh the son of joseph and these are the names of his daughters mahlah noah and hoglah and milcah and tirzah
and they stood before moses and before eleazar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying
our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of korah but died in his own sin and had no sons
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he hath no son give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father
and moses brought their cause before the lord
and the lord spake unto moses saying
the daughters of zelophehad speak right thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying if a man die and have no son then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter
and if he have no daughter then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren
and if he have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren
and if his father have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family and he shall possess it and it shall be unto the children of israel a statute of judgment as the lord commanded moses
and the lord said unto moses get thee up into this mount abarim and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel
and when thou hast seen it thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother was gathered
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of zin in the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the water before their eyes that is the water of meribah in kadesh in the wilderness of zin
and moses spake unto the lord saying
let the lord the god of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation
which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd
and the lord said unto moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him
and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight
and thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient
and he shall stand before eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of urim before the lord at his word shall they go out and at his word they shall come in both he and all the children of israel with him even all the congregation
and moses did as the lord commanded him and he took joshua and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation
and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the lord commanded by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel and say unto them my offering and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire for a sweet savour unto me shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season

and moses told the children of israel according to all that the lord commanded moses
and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord hath commanded
if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth
and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her
and if she had at all an husband when she vowed or uttered ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul
and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the lord shall forgive her
but every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against her
and if she vowed in her husband's house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath
and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the lord shall forgive her
every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them
but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity
these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father's house
and the lord spake unto moses saying
avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people
and moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge the lord of midian
of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war
so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war
and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand
and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the males
and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword
and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly castles with fire
and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and of beasts
and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by jordan near jericho
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp
and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle
and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive
behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord
now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him
but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day
and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all work of goats hair and all things made of wood
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses
only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead
every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation
and divide the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who went out to battle and between all the congregation
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the sheep
take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord
and of the children of israel's half thou shalt take one portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses
and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep
and threescore and twelve thousand beeves
and threescore and one thousand asses
and thirty and two thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with him
and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep
and the lord's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lord's tribute was threescore and twelve
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lord's tribute was threescore and one
and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lord's tribute was thirty and two persons
and moses gave the tribute which was the lord's heave offering unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses
and of the children of israel's half which moses divided from the men that warred
now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep
and thirty and six thousand beeves
and thirty thousand asses and five hundred
and sixteen thousand persons
even of the children of israel's half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses
and the officers which were over thousands of the host the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses
and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us
we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle
the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying
ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon
even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle
wherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan
and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them
thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land
for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them
and the lord's anger was kindled the same time and he sware saying
surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord
and the lord's anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed
and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel
for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people
and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land
we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward
and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will go armed before the lord to war
and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him
and the land be subdued before the lord then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord
but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and be sure your sin will find you out
build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth
and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth
our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead
but thy servants will pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith
so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel
and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession
but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan
and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do
we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be ours
and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to the children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of og king of bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts even the cities of the country round about
and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer
and atroth shophan and jaazer and jogbehah
and bethnimrah and bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep
and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and kirjathaim
and nebo and baalmeon their names being changed and shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded
and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead and took it and dispossessed the amorite which was in it
and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he dwelt therein
and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns thereof and called them havothjair
and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and called it nobah after his own name
these are the journeys of the children of israel which went forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of moses and aaron
and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the lord and these are their journeys according to their goings out
and they departed from rameses in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the egyptians
for the egyptians buried all their firstborn which the lord had smitten among them upon their gods also the lord executed judgments
and the children of israel removed from rameses and pitched in succoth
and they departed from succoth and pitched in etham which is in the edge of the wilderness
and they removed from etham and turned again unto pihahiroth which is before baalzephon and they pitched before migdol
and they departed from before pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness and went three days journey in the wilderness of etham and pitched in marah

and they removed from mount shapher and encamped in haradah
and they removed from haradah and pitched in makheloth
and they removed from makheloth and encamped at tahath
and they departed from tahath and pitched at tarah
and they removed from tarah and pitched in mithcah

and they went from horhagidgad and pitched in jotbathah
and they removed from jotbathah and encamped at ebronah
and they departed from ebronah and encamped at eziongaber
and they removed from eziongaber and pitched in the wilderness of zin which is kadesh
and they removed from kadesh and pitched in mount hor in the edge of the land of edom
and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord and died there in the fortieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the first day of the fifth month
and aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount hor
and king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south in the land of canaan heard of the coming of the children of israel
and they departed from mount hor and pitched in zalmonah
and they departed from zalmonah and pitched in punon
and they departed from punon and pitched in oboth

and they departed from iim and pitched in dibongad
and they removed from dibongad and encamped in almondiblathaim
and they removed from almondiblathaim and pitched in the mountains of abarim before nebo
and they departed from the mountains of abarim and pitched in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
and they pitched by jordan from bethjesimoth even unto abelshittim in the plains of moab
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it
and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell
moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan with the coasts thereof
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim and pass on to zin and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea and shall go on to hazaraddar and pass on to azmon

and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher ahihud the son of shelomi
and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali pedahel the son of ammihud
these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying
command the children of israel that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in and ye shall give also unto the levites suburbs for the cities round about them
and the cities shall they have to dwell in and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts
and the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about
and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites there shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the manslayer that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty and two cities
so all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbs
and the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of israel from them that have many ye shall give many but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye be come over jordan into the land of canaan
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which killeth any person at unawares
and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge
ye shall give three cities on this side jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge
these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
and if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him he shall slay him
but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of wait that he die
or in enmity smite him with his hand that he die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him
but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait
or with any stone wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he die and was not his enemy neither sought his harm
then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest which was anointed with the holy oil
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge whither he was fled
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession
so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings
whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to death
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein i dwell for i the lord dwell among the children of israel
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the chief fathers of the children of israel
and they said the lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters
and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance
and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well
this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them marry to whom they think best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry
so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance
even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad
for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their father's brothers sons
and they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father
these are the commandments and the judgments which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab
there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea
and it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses spake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them
after he had slain sihon the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei
on this side jordan in the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying
the lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount
turn you and take your journey and go to the mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea side to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great river the river euphrates
behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them
and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone
the lord your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude
the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you
how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife
take you wise men and understanding and known among your tribes and i will make them rulers over you
and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do
so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your tribes
and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him
ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is god's and the cause that is too hard for you bring it unto me and i will hear it
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do
and when we departed from horeb we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadeshbarnea
and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us
behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged
and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will send men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come
and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one of a tribe
and they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which the lord our god doth give us
notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god
and ye murmured in your tents and said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us
whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakims there
then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them
the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes
and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place
yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god
who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and in a cloud by day
and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and sware saying
surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your fathers
save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the lord
also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also shalt not go in thither
but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it
moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it
but as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea
then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god commanded us and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready to go up into the hill
and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies
so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill
and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even unto hormah
and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would not hearken to your voice nor give ear unto you
so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode there
then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount seir many days
and the lord spake unto me saying
ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward
and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore
meddle not with them for i will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession
ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall also buy water of them for money that ye may drink
for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked nothing
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from eziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab
and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their land for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possession
the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many and tall as the anakims
which also were accounted giants as the anakims but the moabites call them emims
the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children of esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his possession which the lord gave unto them
now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and we went over the brook zered
and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were come over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as the lord sware unto them
for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy them from among the host until they were consumed
so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people
that the lord spake unto me saying
thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day
and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon distress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon any possession because i have given it unto the children of lot for a possession
that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims
a people great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead
as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day
and the avims which dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead
rise ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold i have given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying
let me pass through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left
thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my feet
as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the moabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us
but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day
and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his land
then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at jahaz
and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote him and his sons and all his people
and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took
from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us
only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto any place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us
then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei
and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon
so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to him remaining
and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of argob the kingdom of og in bashan
all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars beside unwalled towns a great many
and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every city
but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river of arnon unto mount hermon
which hermon the sidonians call sirion and the amorites call it shenir
all the cities of the plain and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan
for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man
and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer which is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereof gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites
and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of og gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh all the region of argob with all bashan which was called the land of giants
jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own name bashanhavothjair unto this day
and i gave gilead unto machir
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon
the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah eastward
and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hath given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war
but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for i know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i have given you
until the lord have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shall ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you
and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shall the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest
ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight for you
and i besought the lord at that time saying
o lord god thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy might
i pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that goodly mountain and lebanon
but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this matter
get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan
but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see
so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor
now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you
your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for all the men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed them from among you
but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one of you this day
behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord my god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it
keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people
for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for
and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day
only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons
specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that they may teach their children
and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darkness
and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a voice
and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone
and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire
lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or female
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth
and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven
but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as ye are this day
furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and sware that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto that good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good land
take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee
for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god
when thou shalt beget children and children's children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger
i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed
and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you
and there ye shall serve gods the work of men's hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul
when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and shalt be obedient unto his voice
for the lord thy god is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them
for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee since the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it
did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou hast heard and live
or hath god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes
unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he is god there is none else beside him
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire
and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of egypt
to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day
know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none else
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever
then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the sunrising
that the slayer might flee thither which should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live
namely bezer in the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth in gilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites
and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel
these are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after they came forth out of egypt
on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of egypt
and they possessed his land and the land of og king of bashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordan toward the sunrising
from aroer which is by the bank of the river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon
and all the plain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain under the springs of pisgah
and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and keep and do them
the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb
the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day
the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
i stood between the lord and you at that time to shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount saying
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
thou shalt have none other gods before me
thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters beneath the earth
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hath commanded thee
six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day
honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
neither shalt thou commit adultery
neither shalt thou steal
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house his field or his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbour's
these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me
and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders
and ye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth
now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall die
for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived
go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it
and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken
o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for ever
go say to them get you into your tents again
but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left
ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess
now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it
that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged
hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey
hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates
and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildedst not
and houses full of all good things which thou filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and be full
then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shalt swear by his name
ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about you
for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earth
ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempted him in massah
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord hath spoken
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the lord our god hath commanded you
then thou shalt say unto thy son we were pharaoh's bondmen in egypt and the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand
and the lord shewed signs and wonders great and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyes
and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers
and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day
and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us
when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than thou
and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them
neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son
for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenly
but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth
the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people
but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations
and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face
thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which i command thee this day to do them
wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers
and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee
thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness and will put none of the evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest upon thee but will lay them upon all them that hate thee
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee
if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them
thou shalt not be afraid of them but shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt
the great temptations which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed
thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the lord thy god is among you a mighty god and terrible
and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee
but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein for it is an abomination to the lord thy god
neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing
all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no
and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty years
thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee
therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills
a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack any thing in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass
when thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he hath given thee
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command thee this day
lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied
then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end
and thou say in thine heart my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this day
and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish
as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face so shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god
hear o israel thou art to pass over jordan this day to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fenced up to heaven
a people great and tall the children of the anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can stand before the children of anak
understand therefore this day that the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them quickly as the lord hath said unto thee
speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thy god hath cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee
not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathers abraham isaac and jacob
understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people
remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the lord
also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath so that the lord was angry with you to have destroyed you
when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i neither did eat bread nor drink water
and the lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written according to all the words which the lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant
and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten image
furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
let me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they
so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands
and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your god and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you
and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and brake them before your eyes
and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto me at that time also
and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and i prayed for aaron also the same time
and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was as small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount
and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye provoked the lord to wrath
likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice
ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you
thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights as i fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroy you
i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand
remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin
lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm
at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood
and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark
and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in mine hand
and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave them unto me
and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lord commanded me
and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the children of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbath a land of rivers of waters
at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day
wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promised him
and i stayed in the mount according to the first time forty days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that time also and the lord would not destroy thee
and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before the people that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them
and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul
to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day for thy good
behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord's thy god the earth also with all that therein is
only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked
for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment
love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt
thou shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name
he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments alway
and know ye this day for i speak not with your children which have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out arm
and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land
and what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this day
and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came into this place
and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he did
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it
and that ye may prolong your days in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey
for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs
but the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of heaven
a land which the lord thy god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year
and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil
and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full
take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them
and then the lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes
and ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house and upon thy gates
that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him
then will the lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be
there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you
behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse
a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day
and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known
and it shall come to pass when the lord thy god hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount ebal
are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the canaanites which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal beside the plains of moreh
for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which i set before you this day
these are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth
ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree
and ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place
ye shall not do so unto the lord your god
but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek and thither thou shalt come
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks
and there ye shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the lord your god giveth you
but when ye go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord your god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety
then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the lord
and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest
but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings and there thou shalt do all that i command thee
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart
only ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth as water
thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill offerings or heave offering of thine hand
but thou must eat them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine hands unto
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border as he hath promised thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh because thy soul longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which the lord hath given thee as i have commanded thee and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike
only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the life and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh
thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water
thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord
only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt take and go unto the place which the lord shall choose
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon the altar of the lord thy god and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god and thou shalt eat the flesh
observe and hear all these words which i command thee that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy god
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their land
take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before thee and that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god for every abomination to the lord which he hateth have they done unto their gods for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods
what thing soever i command you observe to do it thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it
if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder
and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them
thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul
ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him
and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god commanded thee to walk in so shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee
if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers
namely of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth
thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou spare neither shalt thou conceal him
but thou shalt surely kill him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the people
and thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
and all israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the lord thy god hath given thee to dwell there saying
certain men the children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods which ye have not known
then shalt thou enquire and make search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among you
thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the sword
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit for the lord thy god and it shall be an heap for ever it shall not be built again
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand that the lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger and shew thee mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath sworn unto thy fathers
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god to keep all his commandments which i command thee this day to do that which is right in the eyes of the lord thy god
ye are the children of the lord your god ye shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing
these are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox the sheep and the goat
the hart and the roebuck and the fallow deer and the wild goat and the pygarg and the wild ox and the chamois
and every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts that ye shall eat
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof as the camel and the hare and the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof therefore they are unclean unto you
and the swine because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the cud it is unclean unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their dead carcase
these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters all that have fins and scales shall ye eat
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat it is unclean unto you
of all clean birds ye shall eat
but these are they of which ye shall not eat the eagle and the ossifrage and the ospray
and the glede and the kite and the vulture after his kind
and every raven after his kind
and the owl and the night hawk and the cuckow and the hawk after his kind
the little owl and the great owl and the swan
and the pelican and the gier eagle and the cormorant
and the stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat
and every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you they shall not be eaten
but of all clean fowls ye may eat
ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or thou mayest sell it unto an alien for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk
thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year
and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always
and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath blessed thee
then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose
and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice thou and thine household
and the levite that is within thy gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates
and the levite because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest
at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release
and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbour or of his brother because it is called the lord's release
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release
save when there shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it
only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all these commandments which i command thee this day
for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee
if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth
beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought and he cry unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee
thou shalt surely give him and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto
for the poor shall never cease out of the land therefore i command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land
and if thy brother an hebrew man or an hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee
and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this thing to day
and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go away from thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with thee

and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which i have not commanded

and thou shalt come unto the priests the levites and unto the judge that shall be in those days and enquire and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment

but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return no more that way
neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold
and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the levites
and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel
the priests the levites and all the tribe of levi shall have no part nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of the lord made by fire and his inheritance
therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren the lord is their inheritance as he hath said unto them
and this shall be the priest's due from the people from them that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw
the firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him
for the lord thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of the lord him and his sons for ever
and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the lord shall choose
then he shall minister in the name of the lord his god as all his brethren the levites do which stand there before the lord
they shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations

or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee
thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god
for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so to do
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken
according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any more that i die not
and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken
i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him
and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him
but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die
and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him
when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their cities and in their houses
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it
thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts that every slayer may flee thither
and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither that he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time past
as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and live
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he hated him not in time past
wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three cities for thee
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee beside these three
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be upon thee
but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these cities
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die
thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong
then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and the judges which shall be in those days
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother
then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother so shalt thou put the evil away from among you
and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you
and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people
and shall say unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them
for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you
and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her
and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go and return unto his house lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart
and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it
and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee
and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee then thou shalt besiege it
and when the lord thy god hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword
but the women and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations
but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god doth give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth
but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the hittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the lord your god
when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is man's life to employ them in the siege
only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it be subdued
if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath slain him
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain
and it shall be that the city which is next unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley
and the priests the sons of levi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried
and all the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley
and they shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen it
be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israel's charge and the blood shall be forgiven them
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captive
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife

and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife
and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast humbled her
if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated
then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them

and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree
his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother

and now behold i have brought the firstfruits of the land which thou o lord hast given me and thou shalt set it before the lord thy god and worship before the lord thy god
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the lord thy god hath given unto thee and unto thine house thou and the levite and the stranger that is among you
when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year which is the year of tithing and hast given it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that they may eat within thy gates and be filled
then thou shalt say before the lord thy god i have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house and also have given them unto the levite and unto the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed thy commandments neither have i forgotten them
i have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have i taken away ought thereof for any unclean use nor given ought thereof for the dead but i have hearkened to the voice of the lord my god and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me
look down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy people israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou swarest unto our fathers a land that floweth with milk and honey
this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart and with all thy soul
thou hast avouched the lord this day to be thy god and to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and to hearken unto his voice
and the lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments
and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise and in name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the lord thy god as he hath spoken
and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people saying keep all the commandments which i command you this day
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaister them with plaister
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan that ye shall set up these stones which i command you this day in mount ebal and thou shalt plaister them with plaister
and there shalt thou build an altar unto the lord thy god an altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them
thou shalt build the altar of the lord thy god of whole stones and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the lord thy god
and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shalt eat there and rejoice before the lord thy god
and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly
and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel saying take heed and hearken o israel this day thou art become the people of the lord thy god
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day
and moses charged the people the same day saying
these shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people when ye are come over jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph and benjamin
and these shall stand upon mount ebal to curse reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali

cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly and all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person and all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them and all the people shall say amen
and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth
and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god
blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field

and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee
and the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to give thee

and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them
but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee
cursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field
cursed shall be thy basket and thy store
cursed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep
cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out
the lord shall send upon thee cursing vexation and rebuke in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the wickedness of thy doings whereby thou hast forsaken me
the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it

the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed
the lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies thou shalt go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
and thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air and unto the beasts of the earth and no man shall fray them away
the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt and with the emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed
the lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart
and thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore and no man shall save thee
thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her thou shalt build an house and thou shalt not dwell therein thou shalt plant a vineyard and shalt not gather the grapes thereof

thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all the day long and there shall be no might in thine hand
the fruit of thy land and all thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see
the lord shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a sore botch that cannot be healed from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head
the lord shall bring thee and thy king which thou shalt set over thee unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shalt thou serve other gods wood and stone
and thou shalt become an astonishment a proverb and a byword among all nations whither the lord shall lead thee

all thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume
the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very low
he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tail
moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for ever
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand
a nation of fierce countenance which shall not regard the person of the old nor shew favour to the young
and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land until thou be destroyed which also shall not leave thee either corn wine or oil or the increase of thy kine or flocks of thy sheep until he have destroyed thee
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the lord thy god hath given thee
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god hath given thee in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee
so that the man that is tender among you and very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates
the tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and toward her daughter
and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name the lord thy god
then the lord will make thy plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee
also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed
and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god
and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stone
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest but the lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have none assurance of thy life
in the morning thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships by the way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more again and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen and no man shall buy you
these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb
and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land
the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles
yet the lord hath not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day
and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot
ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that i am the lord your god
and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote them
and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh
keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye do
ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the men of israel
your little ones your wives and thy stranger that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water
that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath
but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord our god and also with him that is not here with us this day
for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the nations which ye passed by
and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them
lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood
and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst
the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven
and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it
and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath
even all nations shall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great anger
then men shall say because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt
for they went and served other gods and worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given unto them
and the anger of the lord was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is this day
the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law
and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord thy god hath driven thee
and shalt return unto the lord thy god and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul
that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven from thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee
and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live
and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul
for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off
it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it
neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it
but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it
see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil
in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it
but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them
i denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live
that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel
and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old this day i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan
the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said
and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed
and the lord shall give them up before your face that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded you
be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it
and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed
and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel
and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles
when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing
gather the people together men and women and children and thy stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words of this law
and that their children which have not known any thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it
and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach that thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses and joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation
and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle
and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them
then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because our god is not among us
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are turned unto other gods
now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel
for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant
and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i know their imagination which they go about even now before i have brought them into the land which i sware
moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of israel
and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee
and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished
that moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord saying
take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there for a witness against thee
for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands
and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel the words of this song until they were ended
give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth
my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass
because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god
he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he
they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generation
do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and established thee
remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy elders and they will tell thee
when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel
for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance
he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye
as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings
so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him
he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock
butter of kine and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape
but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation
they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations provoked they him to anger
they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten god that formed thee
and when the lord saw it he abhorred them because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters
and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children in whom is no faith
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation
for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains
i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them
they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust
the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray hairs
i said i would scatter them into corners i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men
were it not that i feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely and lest they should say our hand is high and the lord hath not done all this
for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any understanding in them
o that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end
how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up
for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges
for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter
their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps
is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my treasures
to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste
for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left
and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom they trusted
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and be your protection
see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand
for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever
if i whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward them that hate me
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy
rejoice o ye nations with his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and will be merciful unto his land and to his people
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people he and hoshea the son of nun
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel
and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words which i testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do all the words of this law
for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it
and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day saying
get thee up into this mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession
and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered unto his people
because ye trespassed against me among the children of israel at the waters of meribahkadesh in the wilderness of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel
yet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the children of israel
and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death
and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousands of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them
yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words
moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob
and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of israel were gathered together
let reuben live and not die and let not his men be few
and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord the voice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies
and of levi he said let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one whom thou didst prove at massah and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah
who said unto his father and to his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word and kept thy covenant
they shall teach jacob thy judgments and israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar
bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again
and of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders
and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath
and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things put forth by the moon
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hills
and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren
his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh
and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and issachar in thy tents
they shall call the people unto the mountain there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand
and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head
and he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments with israel
and of dan he said dan is a lion's whelp he shall leap from bashan
and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and the south
and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil
thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength be
there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky
the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy them
israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall drop down dew
happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee o people saved by the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places
and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord shewed him all the land of gilead unto dan
and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto the utmost sea
and the south and the plain of the valley of jericho the city of palm trees unto zoar
and the lord said unto him this is the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over thither
so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord
and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended
and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses
and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face
in all the signs and the wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land
and in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses shewed in the sight of all israel
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying
moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them
only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success
have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest
then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying
pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it
and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe of manasseh spake joshua saying
remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath given you rest and hath given you this land
your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which moses gave you on this side jordan but ye shall pass before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help them
until the lord have given your brethren rest as he hath given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which moses the lord's servant gave you on this side jordan toward the sunrising
and they answered joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go
according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the lord thy god be with thee as he was with moses
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of a good courage
and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into an harlot's house named rahab and lodged there
and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the country
and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be come to search out all the country
and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wist not whence they were
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof
and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate
and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof
and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you
for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and og whom ye utterly destroyed
and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath
now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token
and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death
and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee
then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall
and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way
and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear
behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee
and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him
and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear
and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window
and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not
so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all things that befell them
and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us
and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over
and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host
and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it
yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore
and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for to morrow the lord will do wonders among you
and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people
and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan
and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god
and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites
behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe a man
and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon an heap
and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people
and as they that bare the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest
that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that is beside zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho
and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying
take you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe a man
and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night
then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe a man
and joshua said unto them pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel
that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones
then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever
and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there
and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them
about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho
on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life
and the lord spake unto joshua saying
command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan
joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of jordan
and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did before
and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho
and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal
and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones
then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land
for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever
and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel
at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time
and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins
and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt
now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised
for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey
and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way
and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole
and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year
and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries
and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant
and the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy and joshua did so
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in
and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour
and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days
and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets
and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him
and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord
and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord
and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets
and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout
so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp
and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the lord
and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the ark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets
and the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven times
and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city
and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent
and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it
but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord
so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city
and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword
but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto her
and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel
and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the lord
and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho
and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it
so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout all the country
but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel
and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethaven on the east side of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed ai
and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but few
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai
and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water
and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads
and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side jordan
o lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies
for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great name
and the lord said unto joshua get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face
israel hath sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff
therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you
up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you
in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man
and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel
so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken
and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken
and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken
and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from me
and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done
when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it
so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it
and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord
and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of achor
and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day
and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land
and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it
so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night
and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready
and i and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before them
for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before them
then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand
and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye do see i have commanded you
joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodged that night among the people
and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai
and all the people even the people of war that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai
and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city
and when they had set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley
and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness
and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from the city
and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel
and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city and took it and hasted and set the city on fire
and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers
and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again and slew the men of ai
and the other issued out of the city against them so they were in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape
and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua
and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto ai and smote it with the edge of the sword
and so it was that all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai
for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua
and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even a desolation unto this day
and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this day
then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal
as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peace offerings
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel
and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the people of israel
and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law
there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them
and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof
that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord
and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai
they did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up
and old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy
and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us
and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you
and they said unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye
and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt
and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth
wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldy
and these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey
and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord
and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them
and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim
and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and all the congregation murmured against the princes
but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them
this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them
and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised them
and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us
now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god
and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thing
and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do
and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel that they slew them not
and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose
now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them
that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty
wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying
come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel
therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it
and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us
so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valour
and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee
joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night
and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah
and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword
then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon
and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day
and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal
but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at makkedah
and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah
and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep them
and stay ye not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand
and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities
and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel
then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave
and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon
and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them
and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight
and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening
and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the cave's mouth which remain until this very day
and that day joshua took makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho
then joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him unto libnah and fought against libnah
and the lord delivered it also and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of jericho
and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him unto lachish and encamped against it and fought against it
and the lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel which took it on the second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein according to all that he had done to libnah
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining
and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel with him and they encamped against it and fought against it
and they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to lachish
and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him unto hebron and they fought against it
and they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining according to all that he had done to eglon but destroyed it utterly and all the souls that were therein
and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir and fought against it
and he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none remaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to the king thereof as he had done also to libnah and to her king
so joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god of israel commanded
and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all the country of goshen even unto gibeon
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time because the lord god of israel fought for israel
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal
and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard those things that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of shimron and to the king of achshaph
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of chinneroth and in the valley and in the borders of dor on the west
and to the canaanite on the east and on the west and to the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the mountains and to the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh
and they went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with horses and chariots very many
and when all these kings were met together they came and pitched together at the waters of merom to fight against israel
and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with fire
so joshua came and all the people of war with him against them by the waters of merom suddenly and they fell upon them
and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel who smote them and chased them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they left them none remaining
and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him he houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fire
and joshua at that time turned back and took hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe and he burnt hazor with fire
and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them did joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he utterly destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord commanded
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength israel burned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn
and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither left they any to breathe
as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses
so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same
even from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew them
joshua made war a long time with all those kings
there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all other they took in battle
for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses
and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the mountains from hebron from debir from anab and from all the mountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities
there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained
so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from war
now these are the kings of the land which the children of israel smote and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river arnon unto mount hermon and all the plain on the east
sihon king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and ruled from aroer which is upon the bank of the river arnon and from the middle of the river and from half gilead even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon
and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east and unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea on the east the way to bethjeshimoth and from the south under ashdothpisgah
and the coast of og king of bashan which was of the remnant of the giants that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei
and reigned in mount hermon and in salcah and in all bashan unto the border of the geshurites and the maachathites and half gilead the border of sihon king of heshbon
them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel smite and moses the servant of the lord gave it for a possession unto the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
and these are the kings of the country which joshua and the children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west from baalgad in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak that goeth up to seir which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel for a possession according to their divisions
in the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country the hittites the amorites and the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites
the king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one
the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one
the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one
the king of eglon one the king of gezer one
the king of debir one the king of geder one
the king of hormah one the king of arad one
the king of libnah one the king of adullam one
the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one
the king of tappuah one the king of hepher one
the king of aphek one the king of lasharon one
the king of madon one the king of hazor one
the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph one
the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one
the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam of carmel one
the king of dor in the coast of dor one the king of the nations of gilgal one
the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and one
now joshua was old and stricken in years and the lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed
this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the philistines and all geshuri
from sihor which is before egypt even unto the borders of ekron northward which is counted to the canaanite five lords of the philistines the gazathites and the ashdothites the eshkalonites the gittites and the ekronites also the avites
from the south all the land of the canaanites and mearah that is beside the sidonians unto aphek to the borders of the amorites
and the land of the giblites and all lebanon toward the sunrising from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entering into hamath
all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephothmaim and all the sidonians them will i drive out from before the children of israel only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for an inheritance as i have commanded thee
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the half tribe of manasseh
with whom the reubenites and the gadites have received their inheritance which moses gave them beyond jordan eastward even as moses the servant of the lord gave them
from aroer that is upon the bank of the river arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of medeba unto dibon
and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites which reigned in heshbon unto the border of the children of ammon
and gilead and the border of the geshurites and maachathites and all mount hermon and all bashan unto salcah
all the kingdom of og in bashan which reigned in ashtaroth and in edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did moses smite and cast them out
nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites nor the maachathites but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day
only unto the tribe of levi he gave none inheritance the sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire are their inheritance as he said unto them
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben inheritance according to their families
and their coast was from aroer that is on the bank of the river arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain by medeba
heshbon and all her cities that are in the plain dibon and bamothbaal and bethbaalmeon
and jahaza and kedemoth and mephaath
and kirjathaim and sibmah and zarethshahar in the mount of the valley
and bethpeor and ashdothpisgah and bethjeshimoth
and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites which reigned in heshbon whom moses smote with the princes of midian evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba which were dukes of sihon dwelling in the country
balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them
and the border of the children of reuben was jordan and the border thereof this was the inheritance of the children of reuben after their families the cities and the villages thereof
and moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of gad even unto the children of gad according to their families
and their coast was jazer and all the cities of gilead and half the land of the children of ammon unto aroer that is before rabbah
and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh and betonim and from mahanaim unto the border of debir
and in the valley betharam and bethnimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon jordan and his border even unto the edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward
this is the inheritance of the children of gad after their families the cities and their villages
and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh by their families
and their coast was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom of og king of bashan and all the towns of jair which are in bashan threescore cities
and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan were pertaining unto the children of machir the son of manasseh even to the one half of the children of machir by their families
these are the countries which moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of moab on the other side jordan by jericho eastward
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not any inheritance the lord god of israel was their inheritance as he said unto them
and these are the countries which the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel distributed for inheritance to them
by lot was their inheritance as the lord commanded by the hand of moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe
for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side jordan but unto the levites he gave none inheritance among them
for the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land save cities to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance
as the lord commanded moses so the children of israel did and they divided the land
then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadeshbarnea
forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god
and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's for ever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god
and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day fourscore and five years old
as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in
now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said
and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for an inheritance
hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite unto this day because that he wholly followed the lord god of israel
and the name of hebron before was kirjatharba which arba was a great man among the anakims and the land had rest from war
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by their families even to the border of edom the wilderness of zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea from the bay that looketh southward
and it went out to the south side to maalehacrabbim and passed along to zin and ascended up on the south side unto kadeshbarnea and passed along to hezron and went up to adar and fetched a compass to karkaa
from thence it passed toward azmon and went out unto the river of egypt and the goings out of that coast were at the sea this shall be your south coast
and the east border was the salt sea even unto the end of jordan and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of jordan
and the border went up to bethhogla and passed along by the north of betharabah and the border went up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben
and the border went up toward debir from the valley of achor and so northward looking toward gilgal that is before the going up to adummim which is on the south side of the river and the border passed toward the waters of enshemesh and the goings out thereof were at enrogel
and the border went up by the valley of the son of hinnom unto the south side of the jebusite the same is jerusalem and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of hinnom westward which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of nephtoah and went out to the cities of mount ephron and the border was drawn to baalah which is kirjathjearim
and the border compassed from baalah westward unto mount seir and passed along unto the side of mount jearim which is chesalon on the north side and went down to bethshemesh and passed on to timnah
and the border went out unto the side of ekron northward and the border was drawn to shicron and passed along to mount baalah and went out unto jabneel and the goings out of the border were at the sea
and the west border was to the great sea and the coast thereof this is the coast of the children of judah round about according to their families
and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah according to the commandment of the lord to joshua even the city of arba the father of anak which city is hebron
and caleb drove thence the three sons of anak sheshai and ahiman and talmai the children of anak
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher
and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife
and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife
and it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted off her ass and caleb said unto her what wouldest thou
who answered give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah according to their families
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah toward the coast of edom southward were kabzeel and eder and jagur
and kinah and dimonah and adadah
and kedesh and hazor and ithnan
ziph and telem and bealoth
and hazor hadattah and kerioth and hezron which is hazor
amam and shema and moladah
and hazargaddah and heshmon and bethpalet
and hazarshual and beersheba and bizjothjah
baalah and iim and azem
and eltolad and chesil and hormah
and ziklag and madmannah and sansannah
and lebaoth and shilhim and ain and rimmon all the cities are twenty and nine with their villages
and in the valley eshtaol and zoreah and ashnah
and zanoah and engannim tappuah and enam
jarmuth and adullam socoh and azekah
and sharaim and adithaim and gederah and gederothaim fourteen cities with their villages
zenan and hadashah and migdalgad
and dilean and mizpeh and joktheel
lachish and bozkath and eglon
and cabbon and lahmam and kithlish
and gederoth bethdagon and naamah and makkedah sixteen cities with their villages
libnah and ether and ashan
and jiphtah and ashnah and nezib
and keilah and achzib and mareshah nine cities with their villages
ekron with her towns and her villages
from ekron even unto the sea all that lay near ashdod with their villages
ashdod with her towns and her villages gaza with her towns and her villages unto the river of egypt and the great sea and the border thereof
and in the mountains shamir and jattir and socoh
and dannah and kirjathsannah which is debir
and anab and eshtemoh and anim
and goshen and holon and giloh eleven cities with their villages
arab and dumah and eshean
and janum and bethtappuah and aphekah
and humtah and kirjatharba which is hebron and zior nine cities with their villages
maon carmel and ziph and juttah
and jezreel and jokdeam and zanoah
cain gibeah and timnah ten cities with their villages
halhul bethzur and gedor
and maarath and bethanoth and eltekon six cities with their villages
kirjathbaal which is kirjathjearim and rabbah two cities with their villages
in the wilderness betharabah middin and secacah
and nibshan and the city of salt and engedi six cities with their villages
as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day
and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by jericho unto the water of jericho on the east to the wilderness that goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel
and goeth out from bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth
and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti unto the coast of bethhoron the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are at the sea
so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their inheritance
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east side was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper
and the border went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and the border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on the east to janohah
and it went down from janohah to ataroth and to naarath and came to jericho and went out at jordan
the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah and the goings out thereof were at the sea this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families
and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their villages
and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute
there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the firstborn of joseph to wit for machir the firstborn of manasseh the father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead and bashan
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families
but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and tirzah
and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father
and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of gilead and bashan which were on the other side jordan
because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the rest of manasseh's sons had the land of gilead
and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of entappuah
now manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim
and the coast descended unto the river kanah southward of the river these cities of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh the coast of manasseh also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were at the sea
southward it was ephraim's and northward it was manasseh's and the sea is his border and they met together in asher on the north and in issachar on the east
and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her towns and ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of dor and her towns and the inhabitants of endor and her towns and the inhabitants of taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns even three countries
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land
yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxen strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly drive them out
and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a great people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto
and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get thee up to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites and of the giants if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee
and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns and they who are of the valley of jezreel
and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power thou shalt not have one lot only
but the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though they have iron chariots and though they be strong
and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance
and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the lord god of your fathers hath given you
give out from among you three men for each tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me
and they shall divide it into seven parts judah shall abide in their coast on the south and the house of joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north

but the levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east which moses the servant of the lord gave them
and the men arose and went away and joshua charged them that went to describe the land saying go and walk through the land and describe it and come again to me that i may here cast lots for you before the lord in shiloh

these are the inheritances which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel divided for an inheritance by lot in shiloh before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation so they made an end of dividing the country
the lord also spake unto joshua saying
speak to the children of israel saying appoint out for you cities of refuge whereof i spake unto you by the hand of moses
that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood
and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them
and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbour unwittingly and hated him not beforetime
and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled

then came near the heads of the fathers of the levites unto eleazar the priest and unto joshua the son of nun and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel
and they spake unto them at shiloh in the land of canaan saying the lord commanded by the hand of moses to give us cities to dwell in with the suburbs thereof for our cattle

all the cities of the levites within the possession of the children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them thus were all these cities
and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein
and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand
there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass
then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
and said unto them ye have kept all that moses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god
and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side jordan
but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents
now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them
and he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses
and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar to see to
and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel
and when the children of israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up to war against them
and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into the land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest
and with him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel
and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead and they spake with them saying
thus saith the whole congregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committed against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this day against the lord
is the iniquity of peor too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord
but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel
notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the lord's tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar beside the altar of the lord our god
did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel
the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the lord himself require it
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye to do with the lord god of israel
for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord
therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice
but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the lord
therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and you
god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lord our god that is before his tabernacle
and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of israel and brought them word again
and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad dwelt
and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god
and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age
and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age
and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you
behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward
and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left
that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them
but cleave unto the lord your god as ye have done unto this day
for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day
one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you
take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lord your god
else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you
know for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you
and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath failed thereof
therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lord bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you
when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you
and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god
and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they served other gods
and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac
and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt
i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out
and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea
and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season
and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them from before you
then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warred against israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse you
but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed you still so i delivered you out of his hand
and ye went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand
and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow
and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat
now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord
and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods
for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed
and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god
and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for he is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins
if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good
and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord
and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses
now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel
and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve and his voice will we obey
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem
and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord
and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god
so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance
and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill of gaash
and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the works of the lord that he had done for israel
and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph
and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hill that pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mount ephraim
now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them
and the lord said judah shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand
and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him
and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men
and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites
but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes
and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i have done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalem and there he died
now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the valley
and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now the name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and ahiman and talmai
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher
and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife
and othniel the son of kenaz caleb's younger brother took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife
and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and caleb said unto her what wilt thou
and she said unto him give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs
and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went and dwelt among the people
and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew the canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the name of the city was called hormah
also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof
and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron
and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of anak
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day
and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and the lord was with them
and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of the city before was luz
and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all his family
and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this day
neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean and her towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwell in that land
and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out
neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them
neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries
neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out
neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them
and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley
but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became tributaries
and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim from the rock and upward
and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye done this
wherefore i also said i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you
and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these words unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept
and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed there unto the lord
and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land
and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great works of the lord that he did for israel
and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill gaash
and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served baalim
and they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger
and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies
whithersoever they went out the hand of the lord was against them for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed
nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the lord but they did not so
and when the lord raised them up judges then the lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them
and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which i commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice
i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which joshua left when he died
that through them i may prove israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not
therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua
now these are the nations which the lord left to prove israel by them even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan
only that the generations of the children of israel might know to teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof
namely five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount baalhermon unto the entering in of hamath
and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of moses
and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites hittites and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites
and they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and forgat the lord their god and served baalim and the groves
therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years
and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered them even othniel the son of kenaz caleb's younger brother
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judged israel and went out to war and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against chushanrishathaim
and the land had rest forty years and othniel the son of kenaz died
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel because they had done evil in the sight of the lord
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek and went and smote israel and possessed the city of palm trees
so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years
but when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised them up a deliverer ehud the son of gera a benjamite a man lefthanded and by him the children of israel sent a present unto eglon the king of moab
but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh
and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon was a very fat man
and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away the people that bare the present
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king who said keep silence and all that stood by him went out from him
and ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour which he had for himself alone and ehud said i have a message from god unto thee and he arose out of his seat
and ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly
and the haft also went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out
then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them
when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber
and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth
and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto seirath
and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him from the mount and he before them
and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hath delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went down after him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered not a man to pass over
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man
so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the land had rest fourscore years
and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered israel
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord when ehud was dead
and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles
and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel
and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time
and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment
and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun
and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabin's army with his chariots and his multitude and i will deliver him into thine hand
and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go
and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose and went with barak to kedesh
and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him
now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh
and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor
and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon
and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him
and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet
but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the sword and there was not a man left
howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite
and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantle
and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him
again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is there any man here that thou shalt say no
then jael heber's wife took a nail of the tent and took an hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died
and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and the nail was in his temples
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel
and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailed against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying
praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the people willingly offered themselves
hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel
lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped water
the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from before the lord god of israel
in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways
the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel
they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel
my heart is toward the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the people bless ye the lord
speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and walk by the way
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates
awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty
out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek after thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer
and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar and also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart
why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart
gilead abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches
zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field
the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money
they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against sisera
the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength
then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings the pransings of their mighty ones
curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty
blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be blessed shall she be above women in the tent
he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter in a lordly dish
she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmen's hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples
at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead
the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariots
her wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herself
have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that take the spoil
so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might and the land had rest forty years
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years
and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strong holds
and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them
and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass
for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it
and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord
and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites
that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage
and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land
and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice
and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the midianites
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour
and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites
and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee
and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house
and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man
and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me
depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry until thou come again
and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it
and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight
and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face
and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die
then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him take thy father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by it
and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down
then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built
and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when they enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done this thing
then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it
and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar
therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel
but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him
and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them
and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said
behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said
and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water
and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew
and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground
then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley
and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me
now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand
and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go
so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink
and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water
and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place
so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand
but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host
and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude
and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along
and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the host
and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every man's hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers
and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do
when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon
so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their hands
and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fled
and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every man's sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of abelmeholah unto tabbath
and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after the midianites
and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan
and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan
and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the midianites and they did chide with him sharply
and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer
god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that
and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them
and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian
and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army
and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers
and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him
and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come again in peace i will break down this tower
now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword
and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secure
and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the host
and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up
and caught a young man of the men of succoth and enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men
and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary
and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth
and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city
then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king
and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you
and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth
then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah and zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks
then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy son's son also for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian
and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you
and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites
and they answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey
and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necks
and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto gideon and to his house
thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives
and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son whose name he called abimelech
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites
and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and made baalberith their god
and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side
neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mother's brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mother's father saying
speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh
and his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him
and he went unto his father's house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself
and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem
and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us
but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees
and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us
but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees
then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us
and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees
then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us
and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon
now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
for my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of midian
and ye are risen up against my father's house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he is your brother
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you
but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech
and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there for fear of abimelech his brother
when abimelech had reigned three years over israel
then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech
that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them and upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethren
and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them and it was told abimelech
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him
and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech
and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal and zebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for why should we serve him
and would to god this people were under my hand then would i remove abimelech and he said to abimelech increase thine army and come out
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed his anger was kindled
and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying behold gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and behold they fortify the city against thee
now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the field
and it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion
and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies
and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were with him from lying in wait
and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there come people down from the top of the mountains and zebul said unto him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men
and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of meonenim
then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the people that thou hast despised go out i pray now and fight with them
and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with abimelech
and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate
and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in shechem
and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field and they told abimelech
and he took the people and divided them into three companies and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote them
and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew them
and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the city and sowed it with salt
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they entered into an hold of the house of the god berith
and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together
and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder and said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do make haste and do as i have done
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also about a thousand men and women
then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and took it
but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them and gat them up to the top of the tower
and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech's head and all to brake his skull
then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and said unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a woman slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they departed every man unto his place
thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethren
and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal
and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim
and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was buried in shamir
and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty and two years
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day which are in the land of gilead
and jair died and was buried in camon
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and served not him
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the children of ammon
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead
moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so that israel was sore distressed
and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also served baalim
and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliver you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of ammon and from the philistines
the zidonians also and the amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and i delivered you out of their hand
yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will deliver you no more
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation
and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we pray thee this day
and they put away the strange gods from among them and served the lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel
then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped in gilead and the children of israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mizpeh
and the people and princes of gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah
and gilead's wife bare him sons and his wife's sons grew up and they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in our father's house for thou art the son of a strange woman
then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with him
and it came to pass in process of time that the children of ammon made war against israel
and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob
and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of ammon
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me and expel me out of my father's house and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver them before me shall i be your head
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not so according to thy words
then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people made him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his words before the lord in mizpeh
and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land
and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceably
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon
and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon
but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh
then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent and israel abode in kadesh
then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land into my place
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and fought against israel
and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country
and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan
so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us them will we possess
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them
while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover them within that time
wherefore i have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him
then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon
and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands
then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lord's and i will offer it up for a burnt offering
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hands
and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel
and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter
and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back
and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of ammon
and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows
and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains
and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel
that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year
and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire
and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not out of their hands
and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against me
then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites
and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite if he said nay
then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand
and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah the gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead
and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel
and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and he judged israel seven years
then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem
and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judged israel ten years
and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun
and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonite judged israel
and he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode on threescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekites
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years
and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not
and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son
now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing
for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines
then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name
but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death
then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born
and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her husband was not with her
and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the other day
and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman and he said i am
and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her beware
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that i commanded her let her observe
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour
and the angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after my name seeing it is secret
so manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on
for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the altar and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the ground
but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord
and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god
but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as at this time have told us such things as these
and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the child grew and the lord blessed him
and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol
and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines
and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines now therefore get her for me to wife
then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel
then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnath and came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roared against him
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had done
and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased samson well
and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion
and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion
so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do
and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him
and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments
but if ye cannot declare it me then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it
and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days expound the riddle
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto samson's wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire have ye called us to take that we have is it not so
and samson's wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it my father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee
and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her people
and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger was kindled and he went up to his father's house
but samson's wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friend
but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will go in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer him to go in
and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her
and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless than the philistines though i do them a displeasure
and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails
and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives
then the philistines said who hath done this and they answered samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire
and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i be avenged of you and after that i will cease
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam
then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread themselves in lehi
and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to us
then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them
and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves
and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock
and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed from off his hands
and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith
and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place ramathlehi
and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised
but god clave an hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof enhakkore which is in lehi unto this day
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years
then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went in unto her
and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him
and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before hebron
and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah
and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver
and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee
and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried and she bound him with them
now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the chamber and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire so his strength was not known
and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound
and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man
delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber and he brake them from off his arms like a thread
and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web
and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he awaked out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web
and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth
and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death
that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my mother's womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man
and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he hath shewed me all his heart then the lords of the philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand
and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him
and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wist not that the lord was departed from him
but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven
then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand
and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us
and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for samson that he may make us sport and they called for samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars
and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them
now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport
and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes
and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left
and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twenty years
and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah
and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son
and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee
yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah
and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest
in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes
and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there
and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah as he journeyed
and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may find a place
and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in
and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons
and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah
then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest
in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel
and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they lodged there
when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what hast thou here
and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest
and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous
and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is your way wherein ye go
then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with any man
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their brethren said unto them what say ye
and they said arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land
when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth
and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of war
and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it is behind kirjathjearim
and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the house of micah
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what ye have to do
and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate
and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war
and these went into micah's house and fetched the carved image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said the priest unto them what do ye
and they said unto him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel
and the priest's heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people
so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them
and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men that were in the houses near to micah's house were gathered together and overtook the children of dan
and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned their faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company
and he said ye have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more and what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee
and the children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household
and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house
and they took the things which micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire
and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein
and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first
and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land
and they set them up micah's graven image which he made all the time that the house of god was in shiloh
and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah
and his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her father's house to bethlehemjudah and was there four whole months
and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple of asses and she brought him into her father's house and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him
and his father in law the damsel's father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged there
and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsel's father said unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your way
and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together for the damsel's father had said unto the man be content i pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry
and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there again
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsel's father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and they tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them
and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the damsel's father said unto him behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go home
but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him
and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it
and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we will pass over to gibeah
and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah
and they passed on and went their way and the sun went down upon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin
and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeah and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging
and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites
and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and whence comest thou
and he said unto him we are passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord and there is no man that receiveth me to house
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing
and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street
so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink
now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain sons of belial beset the house round about and beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know him
and the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly
behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them i will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing
but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her go
then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was till it was light
and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were upon the threshold
and he said unto her up and let us be going but none answered then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place
and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel
and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and speak your minds
then all the children of israel went out and the congregation was gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with the land of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh
and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword
now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh then said the children of israel tell us how was this wickedness
and the levite the husband of the woman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge
and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine have they forced that she is dead
and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel
behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and counsel
and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah we will go up by lot against it
and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of a thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit together as one man
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you
now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from israel but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel
but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of israel
and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the inhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not miss
and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war
and the children of israel arose and went up to the house of god and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord said judah shall go up first
and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped against gibeah
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at gibeah
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men
and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day
and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord said go up against him
and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day
and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword
then all the children of israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord
and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days
and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of benjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up for to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand
and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah
and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah as at other times
and the children of benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to the house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty men of israel
and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways
and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put themselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel came forth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah
and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near them
and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children of israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men all these drew the sword
so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the men of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah
and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the edge of the sword
now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city
and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the flame of the city ascended up to heaven
and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjamin were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them
therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them
thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased them and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were men of valour
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of them
so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour
but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months
and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set on fire all the cities that they came to
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife
and the people came to the house of god and abode there till even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore
and said o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel
and it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the lord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day
how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives
and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel that came not up to mizpeh to the lord and behold there came none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly
for the people were numbered and behold there were none of the inhabitants of jabeshgilead there
and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the children
and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by man
and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of canaan
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably unto them
and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so they sufficed them not
and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord had made a breach in the tribes of israel
then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin
and they said there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of israel
howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin
then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the south of lebonah
therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go and lie in wait in the vineyards
and see and behold if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin
and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto them for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be guilty
and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the cities and dwelt in them
and the children of israel departed thence at that time every man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance
in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons
and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of bethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continued there
and elimelech naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons
and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there about ten years
and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband
then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread
wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah
and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mother's house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me
the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept
and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people
and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands
turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have an husband also to night and should also bear sons
would ye tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me
and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother in law but ruth clave unto her
and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law
and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god
where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me
when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her
so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi
and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me
i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me
so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest
and naomi had a kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz
and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter
and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech
and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee
then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this
and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab
and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house
then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens
let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn
then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger
and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore
the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust
then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens
and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left
and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not
so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley
and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed
and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to day and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought and said the man's name with whom i wrought to day is boaz
and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next kinsmen
and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest
and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field
so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law
then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee
and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor
wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking
and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do
and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do
and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law bade her
and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down
and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet
and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman
and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich
and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman
and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i
tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning
and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor
also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city
and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her
and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law
then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day
then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down
and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye down here and they sat down
and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother elimelech's
and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i am after thee and he said i will redeem it
then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance
and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it
now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in israel
therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe
and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelech's and all that was chilion's and mahlon's of the hand of naomi
moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day
and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem
and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bare unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman
so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son
and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in israel
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born him
and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it
and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of jesse the father of david
now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron
and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab
and amminadab begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon
and salmon begat boaz and boaz begat obed
and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david
1sm11 now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite
1sm12 and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children
1sm13 and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there
1sm14 and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions
1sm15 but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb
1sm16 and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb
1sm17 and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat
1sm18 then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons
1sm19 so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord
1sm110 and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore
1sm111 and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head
1sm112 and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth
1sm113 now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken
1sm114 and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee
1sm115 and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord
1sm116 count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto
1sm117 then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him
1sm118 and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad
1sm119 and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her
1sm120 wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel saying because i have asked him of the lord
1sm121 and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow
1sm122 but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he may appear before the lord and there abide for ever
1sm123 and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him
1sm124 and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young
1sm125 and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli
1sm126 and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord
1sm127 for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him
1sm128 therefore also i have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there
1sm21 and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation
1sm22 there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god
1sm23 talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed
1sm24 the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength
1sm25 they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble
1sm26 the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up
1sm27 the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up
1sm28 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lord's and he hath set the world upon them
1sm29 he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail
1sm210 the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed
1sm211 and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest
1sm212 now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord
1sm213 and the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priest's servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand
1sm214 and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither
1sm215 also before they burnt the fat the priest's servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw
1sm216 and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force
1sm217 wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord
1sm218 but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with a linen ephod
1sm219 moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice
1sm220 and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and they went unto their own home
1sm221 and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the lord
1sm222 now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
1sm223 and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people
1sm224 nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the lord's people to transgress
1sm225 if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them
1sm226 and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the lord and also with men
1sm227 and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt in pharaoh's house
1sm228 and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel
1sm229 wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people
1sm230 wherefore the lord god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed
1sm231 behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father's house that there shall not be an old man in thine house
1sm232 and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever
1sm233 and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age
1sm234 and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them
1sm235 and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever
1sm236 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread
1sm31 and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision
1sm32 and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see
1sm33 and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep
1sm34 that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i
1sm35 and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down
1sm36 and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again
1sm37 now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him
1sm38 and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child
1sm39 therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place
1sm310 and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth
1sm311 and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle
1sm312 in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end
1sm313 for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not
1sm314 and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever
1sm315 and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision
1sm316 then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he answered here am i
1sm317 and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee
1sm318 and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good
1sm319 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground
1sm320 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord
1sm321 and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord
1sm41 and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and the philistines pitched in aphek
1sm42 and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men
1sm43 and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies
1sm44 so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god
1sm45 and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again
1sm46 and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp
1sm47 and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretofore
1sm48 woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness
1sm49 be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight
1sm410 and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen
1sm411 and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were slain
1sm412 and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head
1sm413 and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out
1sm414 and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli
1sm415 now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see
1sm416 and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done my son
1sm417 and the messenger answered and said israel is fled before the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god is taken
1sm418 and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged israel forty years
1sm419 and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains came upon her
1sm420 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered not neither did she regard it
1sm421 and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her father in law and her husband
1sm422 and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of god is taken
1sm51 and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod
1sm52 when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon
1sm53 and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him in his place again
1sm54 and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him
1sm55 therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into dagon's house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day
1sm56 but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coasts thereof
1sm57 and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god
1sm58 they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about thither
1sm59 and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret parts
1sm510 therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people
1sm511 so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there
1sm512 and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heaven
1sm61 and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months
1sm62 and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place
1sm63 and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you
1sm64 then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords
1sm65 wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land
1sm66 wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed
1sm67 now therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them
1sm68 and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go
1sm69 and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us
1sm610 and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home
1sm611 and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods
1sm612 and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh
1sm613 and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it
1sm614 and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord
1sm615 and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord
1sm616 and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day
1sm617 and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for askelon one for gath one for ekron one
1sm618 and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite
1sm619 and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter
1sm620 and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us
1sm621 and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you
1sm71 and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord
1sm72 and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel lamented after the lord
1sm73 and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines
1sm74 then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and served the lord only
1sm75 and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for you unto the lord
1sm76 and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpeh
1sm77 and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went up against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines
1sm78 and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines
1sm79 and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him
1sm710 and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before israel
1sm711 and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar
1sm712 then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us
1sm713 so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel
1sm714 and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereof did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites
1sm715 and samuel judged israel all the days of his life
1sm716 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places
1sm717 and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord
1sm81 and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judges over israel
1sm82 now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abiah they were judges in beersheba
1sm83 and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment
1sm84 then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah
1sm85 and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations
1sm86 but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord
1sm87 and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them
1sm88 according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee
1sm89 now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them
1sm810 and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king
1sm811 and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots
1sm812 and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots
1sm813 and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers
1sm814 and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants
1sm815 and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants
1sm816 and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work
1sm817 he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants
1sm818 and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day
1sm819 nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us
1sm820 that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles
1sm821 and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord
1sm822 and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city
1sm91 now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a mighty man of power
1sm92 and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people
1sm93 and the asses of kish saul's father were lost and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses
1sm94 and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not
1sm95 and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us
1sm96 and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go
1sm97 then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we
1sm98 and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way
1sm99 beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer
1sm910 then said saul to his servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where the man of god was
1sm911 and as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here
1sm912 and they answered them and said he is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place
1sm913 as soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find him
1sm914 and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place
1sm915 now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came saying
1sm916 to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me
1sm917 and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people
1sm918 then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seer's house is
1sm919 and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart
1sm920 and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of israel is it not on thee and on all thy father's house
1sm921 and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me
1sm922 and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty persons
1sm923 and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee
1sm924 and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with samuel that day
1sm925 and when they were come down from the high place into the city samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house
1sm926 and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad
1sm927 and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god
1sm101 then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance
1sm102 when thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by rachel's sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do for my son
1sm103 then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine
1sm104 and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands
1sm105 after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy
1sm106 and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man
1sm107 and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for god is with thee
1sm108 and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do
1sm109 and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day
1sm1010 and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them
1sm1011 and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets
1sm1012 and one of the same place answered and said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets
1sm1013 and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place
1sm1014 and saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to samuel
1sm1015 and saul's uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you
1sm1016 and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not
1sm1017 and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh
1sm1018 and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you
1sm1019 and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands
1sm1020 and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near the tribe of benjamin was taken
1sm1021 when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found
1sm1022 therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff
1sm1023 and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward
1sm1024 and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said god save the king
1sm1025 then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house
1sm1026 and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts god had touched
1sm1027 but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought him no presents but he held his peace
1sm111 then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee
1sm112 and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all israel
1sm113 and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee
1sm114 then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept
1sm115 and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh
1sm116 and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly
1sm117 and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent
1sm118 and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand
1sm119 and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh and they were glad
1sm1110 therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you
1sm1111 and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together
1sm1112 and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death
1sm1113 and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel
1sm1114 then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there
1sm1115 and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly
1sm121 and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you
1sm122 and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day
1sm123 behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you
1sm124 and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand
1sm125 and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answered he is witness
1sm126 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt
1sm127 now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers
1sm128 when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place
1sm129 and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them
1sm1210 and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee
1sm1211 and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe
1sm1212 and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king
1sm1213 now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you
1sm1214 if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god
1sm1215 but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers
1sm1216 now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes
1sm1217 is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king
1sm1218 so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel
1sm1219 and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king
1sm1220 and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart
1sm1221 and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain
1sm1222 for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people
1sm1223 moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the right way
1sm1224 only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you
1sm1225 but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king
1sm131 saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel
1sm132 saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent
1sm133 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear
1sm134 and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the philistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal
1sm135 and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven
1sm136 when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits
1sm137 and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling
1sm138 and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him
1sm139 and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering
1sm1310 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him
1sm1311 and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash
1sm1312 therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering
1sm1313 and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever
1sm1314 but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee
1sm1315 and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men
1sm1316 and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped in michmash
1sm1317 and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual
1sm1318 and another company turned the way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness
1sm1319 now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears
1sm1320 but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock
1sm1321 yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads
1sm1322 so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found
1sm1323 and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash
1sm141 now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father
1sm142 and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men
1sm143 and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabod's brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lord's priest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan was gone
1sm144 and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh
1sm145 the forefront of the one was situate northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah
1sm146 and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few
1sm147 and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart
1sm148 then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them
1sm149 if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them
1sm1410 but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us
1sm1411 and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves
1sm1412 and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel
1sm1413 and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew after him
1sm1414 and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow
1sm1415 and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling
1sm1416 and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one another
1sm1417 then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer were not there
1sm1418 and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel
1sm1419 and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand
1sm1420 and saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold every man's sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture
1sm1421 moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time which went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan
1sm1422 likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle
1sm1423 so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto bethaven
1sm1424 and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food
1sm1425 and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground
1sm1426 and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath
1sm1427 but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened
1sm1428 then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint
1sm1429 then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a little of this honey
1sm1430 how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines
1sm1431 and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the people were very faint
1sm1432 and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood
1sm1433 then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day
1sm1434 and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there
1sm1435 and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord
1sm1436 and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god
1sm1437 and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answered him not that day
1sm1438 and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day
1sm1439 for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among all the people that answered him
1sm1440 then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee
1sm1441 therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect lot and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped
1sm1442 and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was taken
1sm1443 then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die
1sm1444 and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan
1sm1445 and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan that he died not
1sm1446 then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place
1sm1447 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them
1sm1448 and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them
1sm1449 now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal
1sm1450 and the name of saul's wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner saul's uncle
1sm1451 and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel
1sm1452 and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him unto him
1sm151 samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord
1sm152 thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt
1sm153 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass
1sm154 and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah
1sm155 and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley
1sm156 and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites
1sm157 and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur that is over against egypt
1sm158 and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword
1sm159 but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly
1sm1510 then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying
1sm1511 it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night
1sm1512 and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal
1sm1513 and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord
1sm1514 and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear
1sm1515 and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed
1sm1516 then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on
1sm1517 and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel
1sm1518 and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed
1sm1519 wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord
1sm1520 and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites
1sm1521 but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal
1sm1522 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams
1sm1523 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king
1sm1524 and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice
1sm1525 now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord
1sm1526 and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel
1sm1527 and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent
1sm1528 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou
1sm1529 and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent
1sm1530 then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god
1sm1531 so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord
1sm1532 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surely the bitterness of death is past
1sm1533 and samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal
1sm1534 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul
1sm1535 and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel
1sm161 and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons
1sm162 and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord
1sm163 and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee
1sm164 and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peaceably
1sm165 and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice
1sm166 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lord's anointed is before him
1sm167 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
1sm168 then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and he said neither hath the lord chosen this
1sm169 then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the lord chosen this
1sm1610 again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these
1sm1611 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither
1sm1612 and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he
1sm1613 then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah
1sm1614 but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him
1sm1615 and saul's servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee
1sm1616 let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well
1sm1617 and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me
1sm1618 then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him
1sm1619 wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep
1sm1620 and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul
1sm1621 and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer
1sm1622 and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight
1sm1623 and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him
1sm171 now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim
1sm172 and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines
1sm173 and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them
1sm174 and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span
1sm175 and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass
1sm176 and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders
1sm177 and the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him
1sm178 and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me
1sm179 if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us
1sm1710 and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together
1sm1711 when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid
1sm1712 now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul
1sm1713 and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah
1sm1714 and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul
1sm1715 but david went and returned from saul to feed his father's sheep at bethlehem
1sm1716 and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days
1sm1717 and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren
1sm1718 and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge
1sm1719 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines
1sm1720 and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted for the battle
1sm1721 for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army
1sm1722 and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren
1sm1723 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them
1sm1724 and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid
1sm1725 and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel
1sm1726 and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god
1sm1727 and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him
1sm1728 and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliab's anger was kindled against david and he said why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle
1sm1729 and david said what have i now done is there not a cause
1sm1730 and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner
1sm1731 and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him
1sm1732 and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine
1sm1733 and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth
1sm1734 and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
1sm1735 and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him
1sm1736 thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god
1sm1737 david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee
1sm1738 and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail
1sm1739 and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him
1sm1740 and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine
1sm1741 and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield went before him
1sm1742 and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance
1sm1743 and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods
1sm1744 and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field
1sm1745 then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied
1sm1746 this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel
1sm1747 and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands
1sm1748 and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine
1sm1749 and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth
1sm1750 so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david
1sm1751 therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled
1sm1752 and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of ekron and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron
1sm1753 and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they spoiled their tents
1sm1754 and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent
1sm1755 and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell
1sm1756 and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is
1sm1757 and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand
1sm1758 and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite
1sm181 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul
1sm182 and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house
1sm183 then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul
1sm184 and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle
1sm185 and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of saul's servants
1sm186 and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of musick
1sm187 and the women answered one another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands
1sm188 and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom
1sm189 and saul eyed david from that day and forward
1sm1810 and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in saul's hand
1sm1811 and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice
1sm1812 and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul
1sm1813 therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people
1sm1814 and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him
1sm1815 wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him
1sm1816 but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and came in before them
1sm1817 and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lord's battles for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him
1sm1818 and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my father's family in israel that i should be son in law to the king
1sm1819 but it came to pass at the time when merab saul's daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife
1sm1820 and michal saul's daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him
1sm1821 and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain
1sm1822 and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the king's son in law
1sm1823 and saul's servants spake those words in the ears of david and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed
1sm1824 and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david
1sm1825 and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the king's enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines
1sm1826 and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the king's son in law and the days were not expired
1sm1827 wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the king's son in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife
1sm1828 and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that michal saul's daughter loved him
1sm1829 and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became david's enemy continually
1sm1830 then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by
1sm191 and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david
1sm192 but jonathan saul's son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself
1sm193 and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee
1sm194 and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to theeward very good
1sm195 for he did put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause
1sm196 and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the lord liveth he shall not be slain
1sm197 and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in times past
1sm198 and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him
1sm199 and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand
1sm1910 and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of saul's presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night
1sm1911 saul also sent messengers unto david's house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal david's wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain
1sm1912 so michal let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped
1sm1913 and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth
1sm1914 and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick
1sm1915 and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him
1sm1916 and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster
1sm1917 and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee
1sm1918 so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth
1sm1919 and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah
1sm1920 and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied
1sm1921 and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also
1sm1922 then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah
1sm1923 and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah
1sm1924 and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets
1sm201 and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life
1sm202 and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so
1sm203 and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death
1sm204 then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee
1sm205 and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even
1sm206 if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family
1sm207 if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him
1sm208 therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father
1sm209 and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee
1sm2010 then said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughly
1sm2011 and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field
1sm2012 and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee
1sm2013 the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father
1sm2014 and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord that i die not
1sm2015 but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth
1sm2016 so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of david's enemies
1sm2017 and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul
1sm2018 then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty
1sm2019 and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel
1sm2020 and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i shot at a mark
1sm2021 and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the lord liveth
1sm2022 but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away
1sm2023 and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever
1sm2024 so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat meat
1sm2025 and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by saul's side and david's place was empty
1sm2026 nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean
1sm2027 and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of the month that david's place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day
1sm2028 and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem
1sm2029 and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren therefore he cometh not unto the king's table
1sm2030 then saul's anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness
1sm2031 for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die
1sm2032 and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done
1sm2033 and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david
1sm2034 so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father had done him shame
1sm2035 and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him
1sm2036 and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him
1sm2037 and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee
1sm2038 and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not and jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master
1sm2039 but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter
1sm2040 and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city
1sm2041 and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded
1sm2042 and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city
1sm211 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee
1sm212 and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place
1sm213 now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is present
1sm214 and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women
1sm215 and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel
1sm216 so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away
1sm217 now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul
1sm218 and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste
1sm219 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here and david said there is none like that give it me
1sm2110 and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath
1sm2111 and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands
1sm2112 and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath
1sm2113 and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard
1sm2114 then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me
1sm2115 have i need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my house
1sm221 david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down thither to him
1sm222 and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men
1sm223 and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me
1sm224 and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold
1sm225 and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and came into the forest of hareth
1sm226 when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him
1sm227 then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds
1sm228 that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day
1sm229 then answered doeg the edomite which was set over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub
1sm2210 and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine
1sm2211 then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his father's house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king
1sm2212 and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered here i am my lord
1sm2213 and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day
1sm2214 then ahimelech answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david which is the king's son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine house
1sm2215 did i then begin to enquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more
1sm2216 and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy father's house
1sm2217 and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord
1sm2218 and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod
1sm2219 and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword
1sm2220 and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david
1sm2221 and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lord's priests
1sm2222 and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house
1sm2223 abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard
1sm231 then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors
1sm232 therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah
1sm233 and david's men said unto him behold we be afraid here in judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines
1sm234 then david enquired of the lord yet again and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand
1sm235 so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah
1sm236 and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand
1sm237 and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars
1sm238 and saul called all the people together to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men
1sm239 and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod
1sm2310 then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake
1sm2311 will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down
1sm2312 then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up
1sm2313 then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth
1sm2314 and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand
1sm2315 and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood
1sm2316 and jonathan saul's son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god
1sm2317 and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth
1sm2318 and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house
1sm2319 then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon
1sm2320 now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand
1sm2321 and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion on me
1sm2322 go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly
1sm2323 see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah
1sm2324 and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of jeshimon
1sm2325 saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon
1sm2326 and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them
1sm2327 but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land
1sm2328 wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth
1sm2329 and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at engedi
1sm241 and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi
1sm242 then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats
1sm243 and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave
1sm244 and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of saul's robe privily
1sm245 and it came to pass afterward that david's heart smote him because he had cut off saul's skirt
1sm246 and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lord's anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord
1sm247 so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way
1sm248 david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself
1sm249 and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou men's words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt
1sm2410 behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the lord's anointed
1sm2411 moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it
1sm2412 the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee
1sm2413 as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee
1sm2414 after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea
1sm2415 the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand
1sm2416 and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david and saul lifted up his voice and wept
1sm2417 and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil
1sm2418 and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not
1sm2419 for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day
1sm2420 and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand
1sm2421 swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house
1sm2422 and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and his men gat them up unto the hold
1sm251 and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran
1sm252 and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel
1sm253 now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb
1sm254 and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep
1sm255 and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name
1sm256 and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast
1sm257 and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel
1sm258 ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son david
1sm259 and when david's young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased
1sm2510 and nabal answered david's servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master
1sm2511 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be
1sm2512 so david's young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayings
1sm2513 and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff
1sm2514 but one of the young men told abigail nabal's wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them
1sm2515 but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields
1sm2516 they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep
1sm2517 now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him
1sm2518 then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses
1sm2519 and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you but she told not her husband nabal
1sm2520 and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert of the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them
1sm2521 now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good
1sm2522 so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall
1sm2523 and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground
1sm2524 and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid
1sm2525 let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send
1sm2526 now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal
1sm2527 and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord
1sm2528 i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days
1sm2529 yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling
1sm2530 and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel
1sm2531 that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaid
1sm2532 and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me
1sm2533 and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand
1sm2534 for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall
1sm2535 so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person
1sm2536 and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabal's heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light
1sm2537 but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone
1sm2538 and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died
1sm2539 and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communed with abigail to take her to him to wife
1sm2540 and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife
1sm2541 and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord
1sm2542 and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife
1sm2543 david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of them his wives
1sm2544 but saul had given michal his daughter david's wife to phalti the son of laish which was of gallim
1sm261 and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon
1sm262 then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph
1sm263 and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness
1sm264 david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come in very deed
1sm265 and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people pitched round about him
1sm266 then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with thee
1sm267 so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him
1sm268 then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time
1sm269 and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lord's anointed and be guiltless
1sm2610 david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish
1sm2611 the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord's anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go
1sm2612 so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul's bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them
1sm2613 then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between them
1sm2614 and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king
1sm2615 and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord
1sm2616 this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lord's anointed and now see where the king's spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster
1sm2617 and saul knew david's voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king
1sm2618 and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand
1sm2619 now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods
1sm2620 now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains
1sm2621 then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly
1sm2622 and david answered and said behold the king's spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch it
1sm2623 the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord's anointed
1sm2624 and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation
1sm2625 then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david went on his way and saul returned to his place
1sm271 and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand
1sm272 and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath
1sm273 and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabal's wife
1sm274 and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him
1sm275 and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee
1sm276 then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day
1sm277 and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months
1sm278 and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt
1sm279 and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to achish
1sm2710 and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites
1sm2711 and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines
1sm2712 and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever
1sm281 and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men
1sm282 and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever
1sm283 now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land
1sm284 and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa
1sm285 and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled
1sm286 and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets
1sm287 then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor
1sm288 and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee
1sm289 and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die
1sm2810 and saul sware to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing
1sm2811 then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel
1sm2812 and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul
1sm2813 and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth
1sm2814 and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself
1sm2815 and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do
1sm2816 then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy
1sm2817 and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david
1sm2818 because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day
1sm2819 moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines
1sm2820 then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night
1sm2821 and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me
1sm2822 now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way
1sm2823 but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed
1sm2824 and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof
1sm2825 and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that night
1sm291 now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel
1sm292 and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish
1sm293 then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day
1sm294 and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the heads of these men
1sm295 is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten thousands
1sm296 then achish called david and said unto him surely as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not
1sm297 wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines
1sm298 and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king
1sm299 and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle
1sm2910 wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light depart
1sm2911 so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel
1sm301 and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire
1sm302 and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way
1sm303 so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives
1sm304 then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep
1sm305 and david's two wives were taken captives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite
1sm306 and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god
1sm307 and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelech's son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david
1sm308 and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all
1sm309 so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed
1sm3010 but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor
1sm3011 and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink water
1sm3012 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights
1sm3013 and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick
1sm3014 we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire
1sm3015 and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this company
1sm3016 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah
1sm3017 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled
1sm3018 and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives
1sm3019 and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them david recovered all
1sm3020 and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said this is david's spoil
1sm3021 and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them
1sm3022 then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart
1sm3023 then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand
1sm3024 for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike
1sm3025 and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day
1sm3026 and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord
1sm3027 to them which were in bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were in jattir
1sm3028 and to them which were in aroer and to them which were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa
1sm3029 and to them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites
1sm3030 and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach
1sm3031 and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt
1sm311 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa
1sm312 and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua saul's sons
1sm313 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was sore wounded of the archers
1sm314 then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it
1sm315 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him
1sm316 so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together
1sm317 and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them
1sm318 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa
1sm319 and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people
1sm3110 and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan
1sm3111 and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistines had done to saul
1sm3112 all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there
1sm3113 and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabesh and fasted seven days
2sm11 now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag
2sm12 it came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance
2sm13 and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped
2sm14 and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also
2sm15 and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead
2sm16 and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him
2sm17 and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and i answered here am i
2sm18 and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite
2sm19 he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me
2sm110 so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord
2sm111 then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him
2sm112 and they mourned and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword
2sm113 and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite
2sm114 and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord's anointed
2sm115 and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and he smote him that he died
2sm116 and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lord's anointed
2sm117 and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son
2sm118 also he bade them teach the children of judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher
2sm119 the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen
2sm120 tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph
2sm121 ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not been anointed with oil
2sm122 from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty
2sm123 saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions
2sm124 ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel
2sm125 how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places
2sm126 i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women
2sm127 how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished
2sm21 and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron
2sm22 so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail nabal's wife the carmelite
2sm23 and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron
2sm24 and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul
2sm25 and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him
2sm26 and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing
2sm27 therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them
2sm28 but abner the son of ner captain of saul's host took ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim
2sm29 and made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel
2sm210 ishbosheth saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followed david
2sm211 and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months
2sm212 and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon
2sm213 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool
2sm214 and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play before us and joab said let them arise
2sm215 then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david
2sm216 and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow's side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon
2sm217 and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david
2sm218 and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe
2sm219 and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner
2sm220 then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and he answered i am
2sm221 and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour but asahel would not turn aside from following of him
2sm222 and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother
2sm223 howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still
2sm224 joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon
2sm225 and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill
2sm226 then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren
2sm227 and joab said as god liveth unless thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother
2sm228 so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more
2sm229 and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to mahanaim
2sm230 and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of david's servants nineteen men and asahel
2sm231 but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abner's men so that three hundred and threescore men died
2sm232 and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night and they came to hebron at break of day
2sm31 now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker
2sm32 and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess
2sm33 and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur
2sm34 and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital
2sm35 and the sixth ithream by eglah david's wife these were born to david in hebron
2sm36 and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house of saul
2sm37 and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine
2sm38 then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dog's head which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman
2sm39 so do god to abner and more also except as the lord hath sworn to david even so i do to him
2sm310 to translate the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba
2sm311 and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared him
2sm312 and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee
2sm313 and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal saul's daughter when thou comest to see my face
2sm314 and david sent messengers to ishbosheth saul's son saying deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines
2sm315 and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from phaltiel the son of laish
2sm316 and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim then said abner unto him go return and he returned
2sm317 and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye sought for david in times past to be king over you
2sm318 now then do it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies
2sm319 and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin
2sm320 so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast
2sm321 and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth and david sent abner away and he went in peace
2sm322 and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace
2sm323 when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace
2sm324 then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone
2sm325 thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest
2sm326 and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew it not
2sm327 and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother
2sm328 and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner
2sm329 let it rest on the head of joab and on all his father's house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh bread
2sm330 so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle
2sm331 and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before abner and king david himself followed the bier
2sm332 and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept
2sm333 and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dieth
2sm334 thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the people wept again over him
2sm335 and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i taste bread or ought else till the sun be down
2sm336 and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people
2sm337 for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner
2sm338 and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel
2sm339 and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness
2sm41 and when saul's son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands were feeble and all the israelites were troubled
2sm42 and saul's son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin
2sm43 and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there until this day
2sm44 and jonathan saul's son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth
2sm45 and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay on a bed at noon
2sm46 and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and rechab and baanah his brother escaped
2sm47 for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night
2sm48 and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed
2sm49 and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity
2sm410 when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings
2sm411 how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth
2sm412 and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron
2sm51 then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
2sm52 also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel
2sm53 so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel
2sm54 david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years
2sm55 in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah
2sm56 and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither
2sm57 nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david
2sm58 and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of david's soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house
2sm59 so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and david built round about from millo and inward
2sm510 and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him
2sm511 and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david an house
2sm512 and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel's sake
2sm513 and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david
2sm514 and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon
2sm515 ibhar also and elishua and nepheg and japhia
2sm516 and elishama and eliada and eliphalet
2sm517 but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold
2sm518 the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim
2sm519 and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand
2sm520 and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim
2sm521 and there they left their images and david and his men burned them
2sm522 and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim
2sm523 and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
2sm524 and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines
2sm525 and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer
2sm61 again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand
2sm62 and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims
2sm63 and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drave the new cart
2sm64 and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark
2sm65 and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals
2sm66 and when they came to nachon's threshingfloor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it
2sm67 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god
2sm68 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day
2sm69 and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me
2sm610 so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite
2sm611 and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his household
2sm612 and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness
2sm613 and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings
2sm614 and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod
2sm615 so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet
2sm616 and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal saul's daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart
2sm617 and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord
2sm618 and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts
2sm619 and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed every one to his house
2sm620 then david returned to bless his household and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself
2sm621 and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord
2sm622 and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honour
2sm623 therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death
2sm71 and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies
2sm72 that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains
2sm73 and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee
2sm74 and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying
2sm75 go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in
2sm76 whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle
2sm77 in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an house of cedar
2sm78 now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel
2sm79 and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth
2sm710 moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime
2sm711 and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house
2sm712 and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom
2sm713 he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever
2sm714 i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men
2sm715 but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee
2sm716 and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever
2sm717 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david
2sm718 then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto
2sm719 and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come and is this the manner of man o lord god
2sm720 and what can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thy servant
2sm721 for thy word's sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them
2sm722 wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears
2sm723 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the nations and their gods
2sm724 for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art become their god
2sm725 and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do as thou hast said
2sm726 and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee
2sm727 for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee
2sm728 and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant
2sm729 therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever
2sm81 and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines
2sm82 and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became david's servants and brought gifts
2sm83 david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates
2sm84 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots
2sm85 and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men
2sm86 then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
2sm87 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem
2sm88 and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass
2sm89 when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer
2sm810 then toi sent joram his son unto king david to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass
2sm811 which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued
2sm812 of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah
2sm813 and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men
2sm814 and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all they of edom became david's servants and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
2sm815 and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment and justice unto all his people
2sm816 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder
2sm817 and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was the scribe
2sm818 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the cherethites and the pelethites and david's sons were chief rulers
2sm91 and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathan's sake
2sm92 and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba and he said thy servant is he
2sm93 and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet
2sm94 and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar
2sm95 then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lodebar
2sm96 now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant
2sm97 and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy father's sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually
2sm98 and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am
2sm99 then the king called to ziba saul's servant and said unto him i have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to saul and to all his house
2sm910 thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy master's son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants
2sm911 then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the king's sons
2sm912 and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth
2sm913 so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the king's table and was lame on both his feet
2sm101 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead
2sm102 then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and david's servants came into the land of the children of ammon
2sm103 and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it
2sm104 wherefore hanun took david's servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away
2sm105 when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return
2sm106 and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men
2sm107 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men
2sm108 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field
2sm109 when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians
2sm1010 and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of ammon
2sm1011 and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee
2sm1012 be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good
2sm1013 and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him
2sm1014 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem
2sm1015 and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel they gathered themselves together
2sm1016 and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them
2sm1017 and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him
2sm1018 and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there
2sm1019 and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more
2sm111 and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem
2sm112 and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon
2sm113 and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite
2sm114 and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house
2sm115 and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child
2sm116 and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and joab sent uriah to david
2sm117 and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered
2sm118 and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and uriah departed out of the king's house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king
2sm119 but uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house
2sm1110 and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey why then didst thou not go down unto thine house
2sm1111 and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing
2sm1112 and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow
2sm1113 and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house
2sm1114 and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah
2sm1115 and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die
2sm1116 and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were
2sm1117 and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also
2sm1118 then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war
2sm1119 and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king
2sm1120 and if so be that the king's wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall
2sm1121 who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also
2sm1122 so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for
2sm1123 and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate
2sm1124 and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the king's servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also
2sm1125 then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him
2sm1126 and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband
2sm1127 and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord
2sm121 and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor
2sm122 the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds
2sm123 but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter
2sm124 and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him
2sm125 and david's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die
2sm126 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity
2sm127 and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul
2sm128 and i gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things
2sm129 wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon
2sm1210 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife
2sm1211 thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun
2sm1212 for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun
2sm1213 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die
2sm1214 howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die
2sm1215 and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriah's wife bare unto david and it was very sick
2sm1216 david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth
2sm1217 and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them
2sm1218 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead
2sm1219 but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead
2sm1220 then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat
2sm1221 then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread
2sm1222 and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live
2sm1223 but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me
2sm1224 and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him
2sm1225 and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah because of the lord
2sm1226 and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city
2sm1227 and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah and have taken the city of waters
2sm1228 now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name
2sm1229 and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it
2sm1230 and he took their king's crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on david's head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance
2sm1231 and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem
2sm131 and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her
2sm132 and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her
2sm133 but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah david's brother and jonadab was a very subtil man
2sm134 and he said unto him why art thou being the king's son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absalom's sister
2sm135 and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand
2sm136 so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand
2sm137 then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnon's house and dress him meat
2sm138 so tamar went to her brother amnon's house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes
2sm139 and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him
2sm1310 and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother
2sm1311 and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister
2sm1312 and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly
2sm1313 and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee
2sm1314 howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her
2sm1315 then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise be gone
2sm1316 and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her
2sm1317 then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her
2sm1318 and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her
2sm1319 and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying
2sm1320 and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom's house
2sm1321 but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth
2sm1322 and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar
2sm1323 and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the king's sons
2sm1324 and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant
2sm1325 and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him
2sm1326 then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee
2sm1327 but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the king's sons go with him
2sm1328 now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnon's heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant
2sm1329 and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded then all the king's sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled
2sm1330 and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the king's sons and there is not one of them left
2sm1331 then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent
2sm1332 and jonadab the son of shimeah david's brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar
2sm1333 now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king's sons are dead for amnon only is dead
2sm1334 but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him
2sm1335 and jonadab said unto the king behold the king's sons come as thy servant said so it is
2sm1336 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore
2sm1337 but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and david mourned for his son every day
2sm1338 so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years
2sm1339 and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead
2sm141 now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward absalom
2sm142 and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead
2sm143 and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her mouth
2sm144 and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king
2sm145 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead
2sm146 and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him
2sm147 and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth
2sm148 and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will give charge concerning thee
2sm149 and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my father's house and the king and his throne be guiltless
2sm1410 and the king said whosoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more
2sm1411 then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth
2sm1412 then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king and he said say on
2sm1413 and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished
2sm1414 for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled from him
2sm1415 now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid
2sm1416 for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god
2sm1417 then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee
2sm1418 then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said let my lord the king now speak
2sm1419 and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid
2sm1420 to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth
2sm1421 and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom again
2sm1422 and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant
2sm1423 so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem
2sm1424 and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the king's face
2sm1425 but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him
2sm1426 and when he polled his head for it was at every year's end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight
2sm1427 and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance
2sm1428 so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the king's face
2sm1429 therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not come
2sm1430 therefore he said unto his servants see joab's field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absalom's servants set the field on fire
2sm1431 then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire
2sm1432 and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the king's face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me
2sm1433 so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom
2sm151 and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him
2sm152 and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel
2sm153 and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee
2sm154 absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice
2sm155 and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him
2sm156 and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel
2sm157 and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto the lord in hebron
2sm158 for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i will serve the lord
2sm159 and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron
2sm1510 but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron
2sm1511 and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing
2sm1512 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite david's counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom
2sm1513 and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom
2sm1514 and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword
2sm1515 and the king's servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint
2sm1516 and the king went forth and all his household after him and the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house
2sm1517 and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off
2sm1518 and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which came after him from gath passed on before the king
2sm1519 then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exile
2sm1520 whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee
2sm1521 and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be
2sm1522 and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him
2sm1523 and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness
2sm1524 and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city
2sm1525 and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation
2sm1526 but if he thus say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him
2sm1527 the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar
2sm1528 see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me
2sm1529 zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there
2sm1530 and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up
2sm1531 and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness
2sm1532 and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head
2sm1533 unto whom david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto me
2sm1534 but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy father's servant hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel
2sm1535 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests
2sm1536 behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadok's son and jonathan abiathar's son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear
2sm1537 so hushai david's friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem
2sm161 and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine
2sm162 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses be for the king's household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink
2sm163 and the king said and where is thy master's son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father
2sm164 then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king
2sm165 and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came
2sm166 and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left
2sm167 and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial
2sm168 the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man
2sm169 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head
2sm1610 and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so
2sm1611 and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him
2sm1612 it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day
2sm1613 and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on the hill's side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust
2sm1614 and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there
2sm1615 and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him
2sm1616 and it came to pass when hushai the archite david's friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king
2sm1617 and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend
2sm1618 and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide
2sm1619 and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the presence of his son as i have served in thy father's presence so will i be in thy presence
2sm1620 then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do
2sm1621 and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy father's concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong
2sm1622 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all israel
2sm1623 and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom
2sm171 moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night
2sm172 and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only
2sm173 and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peace
2sm174 and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel
2sm175 then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith
2sm176 and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thou
2sm177 and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time
2sm178 for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people
2sm179 behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom
2sm1710 and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men
2sm1711 therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person
2sm1712 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one
2sm1713 moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there
2sm1714 and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom
2sm1715 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled
2sm1716 now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him
2sm1717 now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king david
2sm1718 nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a man's house in bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went down
2sm1719 and the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known
2sm1720 and when absalom's servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem
2sm1721 and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you
2sm1722 then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan
2sm1723 and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father
2sm1724 then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he and all the men of israel with him
2sm1725 and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa was a man's son whose name was ithra an israelite that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab's mother
2sm1726 so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead
2sm1727 and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim
2sm1728 brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse
2sm1729 and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness
2sm181 and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them
2sm182 and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joab's brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also
2sm183 but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city
2sm184 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands
2sm185 and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom
2sm186 so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the wood of ephraim
2sm187 where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men
2sm188 for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured
2sm189 and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went away
2sm1810 and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanged in an oak
2sm1811 and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle
2sm1812 and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king's son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom
2sm1813 otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me
2sm1814 then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak
2sm1815 and ten young men that bare joab's armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him
2sm1816 and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people
2sm1817 and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel fled every one to his tent
2sm1818 now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the king's dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absalom's place
2sm1819 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies
2sm1820 and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king's son is dead
2sm1821 then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran
2sm1822 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings ready
2sm1823 but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi
2sm1824 and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone
2sm1825 and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near
2sm1826 and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings
2sm1827 and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings
2sm1828 and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king
2sm1829 and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the king's servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was
2sm1830 and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still
2sm1831 and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee
2sm1832 and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is
2sm1833 and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son
2sm191 and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom
2sm192 and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son
2sm193 and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle
2sm194 but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son
2sm195 and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines
2sm196 in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well
2sm197 now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now
2sm198 then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his tent
2sm199 and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absalom
2sm1910 and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back
2sm1911 and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house
2sm1912 ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king
2sm1913 and say ye to amasa art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab
2sm1914 and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants
2sm1915 so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan
2sm1916 and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david
2sm1917 and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over jordan before the king
2sm1918 and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king as he was come over jordan
2sm1919 and said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart
2sm1920 for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king
2sm1921 but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lord's anointed
2sm1922 and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel
2sm1923 therefore the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him
2sm1924 and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace
2sm1925 and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth
2sm1926 and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame
2sm1927 and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes
2sm1928 for all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king
2sm1929 and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land
2sm1930 and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house
2sm1931 and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan
2sm1932 now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man
2sm1933 and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem
2sm1934 and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem
2sm1935 i am this day fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king
2sm1936 thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward
2sm1937 let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee
2sm1938 and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee
2sm1939 and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place
2sm1940 then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the people of israel
2sm1941 and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all david's men with him over jordan
2sm1942 and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the king's cost or hath he given us any gift
2sm1943 and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel
2sm201 and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel
2sm202 so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem
2sm203 and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood
2sm204 then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three days and be thou here present
2sm205 so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him
2sm206 and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lord's servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us
2sm207 and there went out after him joab's men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri
2sm208 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went before them and joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out
2sm209 and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him
2sm2010 but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab's hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri
2sm2011 and one of joab's men stood by him and said he that favoureth joab and he that is for david let him go after joab
2sm2012 and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still
2sm2013 when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri
2sm2014 and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him
2sm2015 and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down
2sm2016 then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee
2sm2017 and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou joab and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear
2sm2018 then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the matter
2sm2019 i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord
2sm2020 and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy
2sm2021 the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall
2sm2022 then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king
2sm2023 now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites
2sm2024 and adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder
2sm2025 and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the priests
2sm2026 and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david
2sm211 then there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites
2sm212 and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah
2sm213 wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord
2sm214 and the gibeonites said unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you
2sm215 and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel
2sm216 let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them
2sm217 but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lord's oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul
2sm218 but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite
2sm219 and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest
2sm2110 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night
2sm2111 and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done
2sm2112 and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa
2sm2113 and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged
2sm2114 and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was intreated for the land
2sm2115 moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint
2sm2116 and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david
2sm2117 but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel
2sm2118 and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph which was of the sons of the giant
2sm2119 and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam
2sm2120 and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant
2sm2121 and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew him
2sm2122 these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants
2sm221 and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul
2sm222 and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer
2sm223 the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence
2sm224 i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies
2sm225 when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
2sm226 the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me
2sm227 in my distress i called upon the lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears
2sm228 then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth
2sm229 there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it
2sm2210 he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet
2sm2211 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind
2sm2212 and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
2sm2213 through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled
2sm2214 the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice
2sm2215 and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited them
2sm2216 and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils
2sm2217 he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters
2sm2218 he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for me
2sm2219 they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay
2sm2220 he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me
2sm2221 the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
2sm2222 for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god
2sm2223 for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i did not depart from them
2sm2224 i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine iniquity
2sm2225 therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight
2sm2226 with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
2sm2227 with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury
2sm2228 and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down
2sm2229 for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will lighten my darkness
2sm2230 for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall
2sm2231 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him
2sm2232 for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god
2sm2233 god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect
2sm2234 he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places
2sm2235 he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms
2sm2236 thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great
2sm2237 thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip
2sm2238 i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until i had consumed them
2sm2239 and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are fallen under my feet
2sm2240 for thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me
2sm2241 thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me
2sm2242 they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but he answered them not
2sm2243 then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad
2sm2244 thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which i knew not shall serve me
2sm2245 strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear they shall be obedient unto me
2sm2246 strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their close places
2sm2247 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation
2sm2248 it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people under me
2sm2249 and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man
2sm2250 therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name
2sm2251 he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore
2sm231 now these be the last words of david david the son of jesse said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the god of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said
2sm232 the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue
2sm233 the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god
2sm234 and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain
2sm235 although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow
2sm236 but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away because they cannot be taken with hands
2sm237 but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place
2sm238 these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time
2sm239 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away
2sm2310 he arose and smote the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil
2sm2311 and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines
2sm2312 but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory
2sm2313 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim
2sm2314 and david was then in an hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem
2sm2315 and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate
2sm2316 and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord
2sm2317 and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men
2sm2318 and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief among three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among three
2sm2319 was he not most honourable of three therefore he was their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three
2sm2320 and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow
2sm2321 and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian's hand and slew him with his own spear
2sm2322 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among three mighty men
2sm2323 he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard
2sm2324 asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem
2sm2325 shammah the harodite elika the harodite
2sm2326 helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite
2sm2327 abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite
2sm2328 zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite
2sm2329 heleb the son of baanah a netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children of benjamin
2sm2330 benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of gaash
2sm2331 abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite
2sm2332 eliahba the shaalbonite of the sons of jashen jonathan
2sm2333 shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite
2sm2334 eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite
2sm2335 hezrai the carmelite paarai the arbite
2sm2336 igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite
2sm2337 zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah
2sm2338 ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite
2sm2339 uriah the hittite thirty and seven in all
2sm241 and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah
2sm242 for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the people
2sm243 and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing
2sm244 notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel
2sm245 and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and toward jazer
2sm246 then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon
2sm247 and came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even to beersheba
2sm248 so when they had gone through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
2sm249 and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men
2sm2410 and david's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly
2sm2411 for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad david's seer saying
2sm2412 go and say unto david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee
2sm2413 so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me
2sm2414 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man
2sm2415 so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men
2sm2416 and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite
2sm2417 and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against my father's house
2sm2418 and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite
2sm2419 and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord commanded
2sm2420 and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground
2sm2421 and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people
2sm2422 and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood
2sm2423 all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee
2sm2424 and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
2sm2425 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel
1ki11 now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heat
1ki12 wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat
1ki13 so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king
1ki14 and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not
1ki15 then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him
1ki16 and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom
1ki17 and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him
1ki18 but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonijah
1ki19 and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the king's sons and all the men of judah the king's servants
1ki110 but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not
1ki111 wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not
1ki112 now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon
1ki113 go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign
1ki114 behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words
1ki115 and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king
1ki116 and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou
1ki117 and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne
1ki118 and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not
1ki119 and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called
1ki120 and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
1ki121 otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders
1ki122 and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet also came in
1ki123 and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground
1ki124 and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne
1ki125 for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the king's sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah
1ki126 but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called
1ki127 is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
1ki128 then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the king's presence and stood before the king
1ki129 and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress
1ki130 even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day
1ki131 then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever
1ki132 and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king
1ki133 the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon
1ki134 and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon
1ki135 then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah
1ki136 and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too
1ki137 as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david
1ki138 so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king david's mule and brought him to gihon
1ki139 and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon
1ki140 and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them
1ki141 and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar
1ki142 and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings
1ki143 and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king
1ki144 and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule
1ki145 and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard
1ki146 and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom
1ki147 and moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed
1ki148 and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it
1ki149 and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way
1ki150 and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar
1ki151 and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword
1ki152 and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die
1ki153 so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house
1ki21 now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying
1ki22 i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a man
1ki23 and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself
1ki24 that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel
1ki25 moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet
1ki26 do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace
1ki27 but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother
1ki28 and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword
1ki29 now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood
1ki210 so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david
1ki211 and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem
1ki212 then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly
1ki213 and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably
1ki214 he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said say on
1ki215 and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's for it was his from the lord
1ki216 and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on
1ki217 and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife
1ki218 and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king
1ki219 bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother and she sat on his right hand
1ki220 then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay
1ki221 and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife
1ki222 and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah
1ki223 then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life
1ki224 now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day
1ki225 and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died
1ki226 and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted
1ki227 so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh
1ki228 then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar
1ki229 and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him
1ki230 and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me
1ki231 and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father
1ki232 and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah
1ki233 their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord
1ki234 so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness
1ki235 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar
1ki236 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither
1ki237 for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head
1ki238 and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days
1ki239 and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath
1ki240 and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath
1ki241 and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again
1ki242 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good
1ki243 why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with
1ki244 the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head
1ki245 and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever
1ki246 so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon
1ki31 and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about
1ki32 only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the lord until those days
1ki33 and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places
1ki34 and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar
1ki35 in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee
1ki36 and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day
1ki37 and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in
1ki38 and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude
1ki39 give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people
1ki310 and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing
1ki311 and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment
1ki312 behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee
1ki313 and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days
1ki314 and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days
1ki315 and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants
1ki316 then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him
1ki317 and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house
1ki318 and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house
1ki319 and this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it
1ki320 and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom
1ki321 and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear
1ki322 and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king
1ki323 then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living
1ki324 and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king
1ki325 and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other
1ki326 then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it
1ki327 then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof
1ki328 and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment
1ki41 so king solomon was king over all israel
1ki42 and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok the priest
1ki43 elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder
1ki44 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and abiathar were the priests
1ki45 and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and the king's friend
1ki46 and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute
1ki47 and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provision
1ki48 and these are their names the son of hur in mount ephraim
1ki49 the son of dekar in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and elonbethhanan
1ki410 the son of hesed in aruboth to him pertained sochoh and all the land of hepher
1ki411 the son of abinadab in all the region of dor which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife
1ki412 baana the son of ahilud to him pertained taanach and megiddo and all bethshean which is by zartanah beneath jezreel from bethshean to abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond jokneam
1ki413 the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him also pertained the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars
1ki414 ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim
1ki415 ahimaaz was in naphtali he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife
1ki416 baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in aloth
1ki417 jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar
1ki418 shimei the son of elah in benjamin
1ki419 geber the son of uri was in the country of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in the land
1ki420 judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry
1ki421 and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life
1ki422 and solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal
1ki423 ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl
1ki424 for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him
1ki425 and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon
1ki426 and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen
1ki427 and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all that came unto king solomon's table every man in his month they lacked nothing
1ki428 barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were every man according to his charge
1ki429 and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore
1ki430 and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt
1ki431 for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all nations round about
1ki432 and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five
1ki433 and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes
1ki434 and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom
1ki51 and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david
1ki52 and solomon sent to hiram saying
1ki53 thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of his feet
1ki54 but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent
1ki55 and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my name
1ki56 now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians
1ki57 and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people
1ki58 and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir
1ki59 my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household
1ki510 so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire
1ki511 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year
1ki512 and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together
1ki513 and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men
1ki514 and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy
1ki515 and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains
1ki516 beside the chief of solomon's officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work
1ki517 and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house
1ki518 and solomon's builders and hiram's builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house
1ki61 and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomon's reign over israel in the month zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord
1ki62 and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits
1ki63 and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house
1ki64 and for the house he made windows of narrow lights
1ki65 and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round about
1ki66 the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house
1ki67 and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building
1ki68 the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third
1ki69 so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar
1ki610 and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar
1ki611 and the word of the lord came to solomon saying
1ki612 concerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father
1ki613 and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel
1ki614 so solomon built the house and finished it
1ki615 and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir
1ki616 and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy place
1ki617 and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits long
1ki618 and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen
1ki619 and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord
1ki620 and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedar
1ki621 so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold
1ki622 and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold
1ki623 and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each ten cubits high
1ki624 and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits
1ki625 and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of one measure and one size
1ki626 the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub
1ki627 and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house
1ki628 and he overlaid the cherubims with gold
1ki629 and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and without
1ki630 and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold within and without
1ki631 and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall
1ki632 the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees
1ki633 so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall
1ki634 and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding
1ki635 and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work
1ki636 and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams
1ki637 in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month zif
1ki638 and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he seven years in building it
1ki71 but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house
1ki72 he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars
1ki73 and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty five pillars fifteen in a row
1ki74 and there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranks
1ki75 and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and light was against light in three ranks
1ki76 and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them
1ki77 then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other
1ki78 and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch which was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch
1ki79 all these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great court
1ki710 and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits
1ki711 and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedars
1ki712 and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the house of the lord and for the porch of the house
1ki713 and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre
1ki714 he was a widow's son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work
1ki715 for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about
1ki716 and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits
1ki717 and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter
1ki718 and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter
1ki719 and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch four cubits
1ki720 and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above over against the belly which was by the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter
1ki721 and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz
1ki722 and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finished
1ki723 and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
1ki724 and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were cast in two rows when it was cast
1ki725 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward
1ki726 and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand baths
1ki727 and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it
1ki728 and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges
1ki729 and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work
1ki730 and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every addition
1ki731 and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not round
1ki732 and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit
1ki733 and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all molten
1ki734 and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itself
1ki735 and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same
1ki736 for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round about
1ki737 after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one size
1ki738 then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laver
1ki739 and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south
1ki740 and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord
1ki741 the two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars
1ki742 and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars
1ki743 and the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases
1ki744 and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea
1ki745 and the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord were of bright brass
1ki746 in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan
1ki747 and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out
1ki748 and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shewbread was
1ki749 and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold
1ki750 and the bowls and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the temple
1ki751 so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord
1ki81 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion
1ki82 and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month
1ki83 and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark
1ki84 and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priests and the levites bring up
1ki85 and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude
1ki86 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims
1ki87 for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
1ki88 and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day
1ki89 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt
1ki810 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord
1ki811 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord
1ki812 then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
1ki813 i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever
1ki814 and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood
1ki815 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying
1ki816 since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel
1ki817 and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel
1ki818 and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart
1ki819 nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name
1ki820 and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel
1ki821 and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt
1ki822 and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
1ki823 and he said lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart
1ki824 who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day
1ki825 therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me
1ki826 and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father
1ki827 but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded
1ki828 yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day
1ki829 that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place
1ki830 and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive
1ki831 if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house
1ki832 then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness
1ki833 when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house
1ki834 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers
1ki835 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them
1ki836 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance
1ki837 if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be
1ki838 what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house
1ki839 then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men
1ki840 that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
1ki841 moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake
1ki842 for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house
1ki843 hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy name
1ki844 if thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house that i have built for thy name
1ki845 then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause
1ki846 if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near
1ki847 yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickedness
1ki848 and so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name
1ki849 then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their cause
1ki850 and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them
1ki851 for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron
1ki852 that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee
1ki853 for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord god
1ki854 and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven
1ki855 and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice saying
1ki856 blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servant
1ki857 the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us
1ki858 that he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers
1ki859 and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel at all times as the matter shall require
1ki860 that all the people of the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else
1ki861 let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day
1ki862 and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before the lord
1ki863 and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord
1ki864 the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings
1ki865 and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days
1ki866 on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel his people
1ki91 and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the king's house and all solomon's desire which he was pleased to do
1ki92 that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon
1ki93 and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
1ki94 and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments
1ki95 then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel
1ki96 but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
1ki97 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people
1ki98 and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house
1ki99 and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil
1ki910 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the king's house
1ki911 now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee
1ki912 and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not
1ki913 and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day
1ki914 and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold
1ki915 and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer
1ki916 for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter solomon's wife
1ki917 and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether
1ki918 and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land
1ki919 and all the cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
1ki920 and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel
1ki921 their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day
1ki922 but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen
1ki923 these were the chief of the officers that were over solomon's work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work
1ki924 but pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo
1ki925 and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished the house
1ki926 and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom
1ki927 and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon
1ki928 and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon
1ki101 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions
1ki102 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart
1ki103 and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not
1ki104 and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built
1ki105 and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
1ki106 and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom
1ki107 howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard
1ki108 happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom
1ki109 blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice
1ki1010 and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon
1ki1011 and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones
1ki1012 and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord and for the king's house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day
1ki1013 and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants
1ki1014 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold
1ki1015 beside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country
1ki1016 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one target
1ki1017 and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon
1ki1018 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold
1ki1019 the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the stays
1ki1020 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom
1ki1021 and all king solomon's drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon
1ki1022 for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks
1ki1023 so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom
1ki1024 and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart
1ki1025 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year
1ki1026 and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at jerusalem
1ki1027 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance
1ki1028 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
1ki1029 and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means
1ki111 but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites
1ki112 of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love
1ki113 and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart
1ki114 for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father
1ki115 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites
1ki116 and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father
1ki117 then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon
1ki118 and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods
1ki119 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice
1ki1110 and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded
1ki1111 wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant
1ki1112 notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy father's sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son
1ki1113 howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant's sake and for jerusalem's sake which i have chosen
1ki1114 and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the king's seed in edom
1ki1115 for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in edom
1ki1116 for six months did joab remain there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom
1ki1117 that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his father's servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child
1ki1118 and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land
1ki1119 and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen
1ki1120 and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh's house and genubath was in pharaoh's household among the sons of pharaoh
1ki1121 and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country
1ki1122 then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise
1ki1123 and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah
1ki1124 and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus
1ki1125 and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria
1ki1126 and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomon's servant whose mother's name was zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king
1ki1127 and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father
1ki1128 and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph
1ki1129 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field
1ki1130 and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces
1ki1131 and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee
1ki1132 but he shall have one tribe for my servant david's sake and for jerusalem's sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel
1ki1133 because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his father
1ki1134 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant's sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes
1ki1135 but i will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes
1ki1136 and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there
1ki1137 and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel
1ki1138 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee
1ki1139 and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever
1ki1140 solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon
1ki1141 and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon
1ki1142 and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years
1ki1143 and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
1ki121 and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king
1ki122 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt
1ki123 that they sent and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saying
1ki124 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee
1ki125 and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people departed
1ki126 and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that i may answer this people
1ki127 and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever
1ki128 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him
1ki129 and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter
1ki1210 and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins
1ki1211 and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
1ki1212 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day
1ki1213 and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him
1ki1214 and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
1ki1215 wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat
1ki1216 so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto their tents
1ki1217 but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them
1ki1218 then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem
1ki1219 so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day
1ki1220 and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only
1ki1221 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon
1ki1222 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying
1ki1223 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people saying
1ki1224 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the lord
1ki1225 then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built penuel
1ki1226 and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david
1ki1227 if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah
1ki1228 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
1ki1229 and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan
1ki1230 and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan
1ki1231 and he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi
1ki1232 and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made
1ki1233 so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense
1ki131 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense
1ki132 and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee
1ki133 and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out
1ki134 and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him
1ki135 the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord
1ki136 and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the king's hand was restored him again and became as it was before
1ki137 and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward
1ki138 and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place
1ki139 for so was it charged me by the word of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest
1ki1310 so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel
1ki1311 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their father
1ki1312 and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah
1ki1313 and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon
1ki1314 and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am
1ki1315 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread
1ki1316 and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place
1ki1317 for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest
1ki1318 he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him
1ki1319 so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water
1ki1320 and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back
1ki1321 and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee
1ki1322 but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers
1ki1323 and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought back
1ki1324 and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcase
1ki1325 and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt
1ki1326 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord which he spake unto him
1ki1327 and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they saddled him
1ki1328 and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass
1ki1329 and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him
1ki1330 and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother
1ki1331 and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones
1ki1332 for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass
1ki1333 after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high places
1ki1334 and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth
1ki141 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick
1ki142 and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me that i should be king over this people
1ki143 and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the child
1ki144 and jeroboam's wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age
1ki145 and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman
1ki146 and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings
1ki147 go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel
1ki148 and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes
1ki149 but hast done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back
1ki1410 therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone
1ki1411 him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it
1ki1412 arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die
1ki1413 and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam
1ki1414 moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now
1ki1415 for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger
1ki1416 and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who did sin and who made israel to sin
1ki1417 and jeroboam's wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and when she came to the threshold of the door the child died
1ki1418 and they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet
1ki1419 and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1420 and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead
1ki1421 and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess
1ki1422 and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers had done
1ki1423 for they also built them high places and images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree
1ki1424 and there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel
1ki1425 and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem
1ki1426 and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made
1ki1427 and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept the door of the king's house
1ki1428 and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard chamber
1ki1429 now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
1ki1430 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days
1ki1431 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead
1ki151 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah
1ki152 three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother's name was maachah the daughter of abishalom
1ki153 and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as the heart of david his father
1ki154 nevertheless for david's sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem
1ki155 because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite
1ki156 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life
1ki157 now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam
1ki158 and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead
1ki159 and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah
1ki1510 and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother's name was maachah the daughter of abishalom
1ki1511 and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father
1ki1512 and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made
1ki1513 and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook kidron
1ki1514 but the high places were not removed nevertheless asa's heart was perfect with the lord all his days
1ki1515 and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord silver and gold and vessels
1ki1516 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
1ki1517 and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah
1ki1518 then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying
1ki1519 there is a league between me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me
1ki1520 so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of naphtali
1ki1521 and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building of ramah and dwelt in tirzah
1ki1522 then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them geba of benjamin and mizpah
1ki1523 the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet
1ki1524 and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead
1ki1525 and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years
1ki1526 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
1ki1527 and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon
1ki1528 even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him and reigned in his stead
1ki1529 and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite
1ki1530 because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger
1ki1531 now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1532 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
1ki1533 in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years
1ki1534 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
1ki161 then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying
1ki162 forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins
1ki163 behold i will take away the posterity of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat
1ki164 him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat
1ki165 now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki166 so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead
1ki167 and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he killed him
1ki168 in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years
1ki169 and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah
1ki1610 and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead
1ki1611 and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends
1ki1612 thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet
1ki1613 for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities
1ki1614 now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1615 in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines
1ki1616 and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp
1ki1617 and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah
1ki1618 and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the palace of the king's house and burnt the king's house over him with fire and died
1ki1619 for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin
1ki1620 now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1621 then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri
1ki1622 but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned
1ki1623 in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah
1ki1624 and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria
1ki1625 but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse than all that were before him
1ki1626 for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities
1ki1627 now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1628 so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead
1ki1629 and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years
1ki1630 and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him
1ki1631 and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him
1ki1632 and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria
1ki1633 and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him
1ki1634 in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun
1ki171 and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word
1ki172 and the word of the lord came unto him saying
1ki173 get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan
1ki174 and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there
1ki175 so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan
1ki176 and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook
1ki177 and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land
1ki178 and the word of the lord came unto him saying
1ki179 arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee
1ki1710 so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink
1ki1711 and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand
1ki1712 and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die
1ki1713 and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son
1ki1714 for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth
1ki1715 and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days
1ki1716 and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah
1ki1717 and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him
1ki1718 and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son
1ki1719 and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed
1ki1720 and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son
1ki1721 and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this child's soul come into him again
1ki1722 and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived
1ki1723 and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth
1ki1724 and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth
1ki181 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth
1ki182 and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria
1ki183 and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly
1ki184 for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water
1ki185 and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts
1ki186 so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself
1ki187 and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord elijah
1ki188 and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here
1ki189 and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me
1ki1810 as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not
1ki1811 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here
1ki1812 and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth
1ki1813 was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lord's prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water
1ki1814 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me
1ki1815 and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day
1ki1816 so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah
1ki1817 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel
1ki1818 and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim
1ki1819 now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebel's table
1ki1820 so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel
1ki1821 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word
1ki1822 then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men
1ki1823 let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under
1ki1824 and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken
1ki1825 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under
1ki1826 and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made
1ki1827 and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked
1ki1828 and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them
1ki1829 and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded
1ki1830 and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down
1ki1831 and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name
1ki1832 and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed
1ki1833 and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood
1ki1834 and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time
1ki1835 and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water
1ki1836 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word
1ki1837 hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again
1ki1838 then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench
1ki1839 and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god
1ki1840 and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there
1ki1841 and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain
1ki1842 so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees
1ki1843 and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times
1ki1844 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not
1ki1845 and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and went to jezreel
1ki1846 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel
1ki191 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword
1ki192 then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time
1ki193 and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there
1ki194 but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers
1ki195 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat
1ki196 and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again
1ki197 and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee
1ki198 and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god
1ki199 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah
1ki1910 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away
1ki1911 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake
1ki1912 and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice
1ki1913 and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah
1ki1914 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away
1ki1915 and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king over syria
1ki1916 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
1ki1917 and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay
1ki1918 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him
1ki1919 so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him
1ki1920 and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee
1ki1921 and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him
1ki201 and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it
1ki202 and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad
1ki203 thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine
1ki204 and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have
1ki205 and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children
1ki206 yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away
1ki207 then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not
1ki208 and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent
1ki209 wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again
1ki2010 and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me
1ki2011 and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off
1ki2012 and it came to pass when benhadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array against the city
1ki2013 and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord
1ki2014 and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou
1ki2015 then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand
1ki2016 and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him
1ki2017 and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria
1ki2018 and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive
1ki2019 so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed them
1ki2020 and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen
1ki2021 and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter
1ki2022 and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee
1ki2023 and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they
1ki2024 and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms
1ki2025 and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and did so
1ki2026 and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel
1ki2027 and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country
1ki2028 and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord
1ki2029 and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day
1ki2030 but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber
1ki2031 and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life
1ki2032 so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is my brother
1ki2033 now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot
1ki2034 and benhadad said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent him away
1ki2035 and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man refused to smite him
1ki2036 then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him
1ki2037 then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him
1ki2038 so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face
1ki2039 and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver
1ki2040 and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it
1ki2041 and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets
1ki2042 and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people
1ki2043 and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria
1ki211 and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria
1ki212 and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money
1ki213 and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee
1ki214 and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread
1ki215 but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread
1ki216 and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard
1ki217 and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite
1ki218 so she wrote letters in ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth
1ki219 and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people
1ki2110 and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die
1ki2111 and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them
1ki2112 they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people
1ki2113 and there came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died
1ki2114 then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead
1ki2115 and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead
1ki2116 and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it
1ki2117 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
1ki2118 arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it
1ki2119 and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine
1ki2120 and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord
1ki2121 behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel
1ki2122 and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin
1ki2123 and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel
1ki2124 him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat
1ki2125 but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up
1ki2126 and he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel
1ki2127 and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly
1ki2128 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
1ki2129 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his son's days will i bring the evil upon his house
1ki221 and they continued three years without war between syria and israel
1ki222 and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel
1ki223 and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria
1ki224 and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses
1ki225 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day
1ki226 then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king
1ki227 and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him
1ki228 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
1ki229 then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah
1ki2210 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
1ki2211 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them
1ki2212 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the king's hand
1ki2213 and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good
1ki2214 and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak
1ki2215 so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king
1ki2216 and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord
1ki2217 and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace
1ki2218 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil
1ki2219 and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left
1ki2220 and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner
1ki2221 and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him
1ki2222 and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so
1ki2223 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee
1ki2224 but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee
1ki2225 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
1ki2226 and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the king's son
1ki2227 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace
1ki2228 and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you
1ki2229 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead
1ki2230 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle
1ki2231 but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel
1ki2232 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out
1ki2233 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him
1ki2234 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded
1ki2235 and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot
1ki2236 and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his own country
1ki2237 so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria
1ki2238 and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the word of the lord which he spake
1ki2239 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki2240 so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
1ki2241 and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel
1ki2242 jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mother's name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
1ki2243 and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places
1ki2244 and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel
1ki2245 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
1ki2246 and the remnant of the sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out of the land
1ki2247 there was then no king in edom a deputy was king
1ki2248 jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber
1ki2249 then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not
1ki2250 and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead
1ki2251 ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two years over israel
1ki2252 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
1ki2253 for he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of israel according to all that his father had done
2ki11 then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab
2ki12 and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease
2ki13 but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron
2ki14 now therefore thus saith the lord thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die and elijah departed
2ki15 and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them why are ye now turned back
2ki16 and they said unto him there came a man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die
2ki17 and he said unto them what manner of man was he which came up to meet you and told you these words
2ki18 and they answered him he was an hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is elijah the tishbite
2ki19 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty and he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill and he spake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down
2ki110 and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a man of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
2ki111 again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king said come down quickly
2ki112 and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
2ki113 and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight
2ki114 behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight
2ki115 and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king
2ki116 and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not because there is no god in israel to enquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die
2ki117 so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son
2ki118 now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki21 and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal
2ki22 and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel
2ki23 and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace
2ki24 and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho
2ki25 and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace
2ki26 and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on
2ki27 and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they two stood by jordan
2ki28 and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground
2ki29 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me
2ki210 and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so
2ki211 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven
2ki212 and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces
2ki213 he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan
2ki214 and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over
2ki215 and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him
2ki216 and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not send
2ki217 and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not
2ki218 and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he said unto them did i not say unto you go not
2ki219 and the men of the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the ground barren
2ki220 and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they brought it to him
2ki221 and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land
2ki222 so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of elisha which he spake
2ki223 and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head
2ki224 and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them
2ki225 and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he returned to samaria
2ki31 now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years
2ki32 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made
2ki33 nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom
2ki34 and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the king of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand rams with the wool
2ki35 but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel
2ki36 and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered all israel
2ki37 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses
2ki38 and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom
2ki39 so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them
2ki310 and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab
2ki311 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king of israel's servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah
2ki312 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him
2ki313 and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab
2ki314 and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee
2ki315 but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him
2ki316 and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches
2ki317 for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts
2ki318 and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand
2ki319 and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones
2ki320 and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water
2ki321 and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour and upward and stood in the border
2ki322 and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood
2ki323 and they said this is blood the kings are surely slain and they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil
2ki324 and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they went forward smiting the moabites even in their country
2ki325 and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it
2ki326 and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break through even unto the king of edom but they could not
2ki327 then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and there was great indignation against israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land
2ki41 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen
2ki42 and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oil
2ki43 then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few
2ki44 and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full
2ki45 so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out
2ki46 and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed
2ki47 then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest
2ki48 and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread
2ki49 and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is an holy man of god which passeth by us continually
2ki410 let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither
2ki411 and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay there
2ki412 and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and when he had called her she stood before him
2ki413 and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered i dwell among mine own people
2ki414 and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old
2ki415 and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door
2ki416 and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of god do not lie unto thine handmaid
2ki417 and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that elisha had said unto her according to the time of life
2ki418 and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers
2ki419 and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a lad carry him to his mother
2ki420 and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died
2ki421 and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door upon him and went out
2ki422 and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again
2ki423 and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well
2ki424 then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not thy riding for me except i bid thee
2ki425 so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite
2ki426 run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well
2ki427 and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet but gehazi came near to thrust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me
2ki428 then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me
2ki429 then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child
2ki430 and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her
2ki431 and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awaked
2ki432 and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed
2ki433 he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord
2ki434 and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm
2ki435 then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes
2ki436 and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son
2ki437 then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out
2ki438 and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets
2ki439 and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not
2ki440 so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o thou man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof
2ki441 but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot
2ki442 and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that they may eat
2ki443 and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundred men he said again give the people that they may eat for thus saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof
2ki444 so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the lord
2ki51 now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honourable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper
2ki52 and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife
2ki53 and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy
2ki54 and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel
2ki55 and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment
2ki56 and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy
2ki57 and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me
2ki58 and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel
2ki59 so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elisha
2ki510 and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean
2ki511 but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper
2ki512 are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage
2ki513 and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean
2ki514 then went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean
2ki515 and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant
2ki516 but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused
2ki517 and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the lord
2ki518 in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing
2ki519 and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a little way
2ki520 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run after him and take somewhat of him
2ki521 so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is all well
2ki522 and he said all is well my master hath sent me saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garments
2ki523 and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before him
2ki524 and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed
2ki525 but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no whither
2ki526 and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants
2ki527 the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow
2ki61 and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us
2ki62 let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he answered go ye
2ki63 and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered i will go
2ki64 so he went with them and when they came to jordan they cut down wood
2ki65 but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water and he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed
2ki66 and the man of god said where fell it and he shewed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did swim
2ki67 therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his hand and took it
2ki68 then the king of syria warred against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp
2ki69 and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down
2ki610 and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice
2ki611 therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of israel
2ki612 and one of his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber
2ki613 and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan
2ki614 therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about
2ki615 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do
2ki616 and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them
2ki617 and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha
2ki618 and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha
2ki619 and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek but he led them to samaria
2ki620 and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria
2ki621 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them
2ki622 and he answered thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master
2ki623 and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel
2ki624 and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syria gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria
2ki625 and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver
2ki626 and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king
2ki627 and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i help thee out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress
2ki628 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will eat my son to morrow
2ki629 so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son
2ki630 and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and the people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh
2ki631 then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day
2ki632 but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his master's feet behind him
2ki633 and while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of the lord what should i wait for the lord any longer
2ki71 then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria
2ki72 then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof
2ki73 and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die
2ki74 if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die
2ki75 and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there
2ki76 for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us
2ki77 wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life
2ki78 and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid it
2ki79 then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household
2ki710 so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they were
2ki711 and he called the porters and they told it to the king's house within
2ki712 and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city
2ki713 and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it behold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelites that are consumed and let us send and see
2ki714 they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see
2ki715 and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their haste and the messengers returned and told the king
2ki716 and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord
2ki717 and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down to him
2ki718 and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria
2ki719 and that lord answered the man of god and said now behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof
2ki720 and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the gate and he died
2ki81 then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years
2ki82 and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years
2ki83 and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land
2ki84 and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done
2ki85 and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life
2ki86 and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now
2ki87 and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither
2ki88 and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand and go meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shall i recover of this disease
2ki89 so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this disease
2ki810 and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die
2ki811 and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed and the man of god wept
2ki812 and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child
2ki813 and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over syria
2ki814 so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou shouldest surely recover
2ki815 and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and hazael reigned in his stead
2ki816 and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of je hoshaphat king of judah began to reign
2ki817 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem
2ki818 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the lord
2ki819 yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servant's sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his children
2ki820 in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves
2ki821 so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and he rose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents
2ki822 yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then libnah revolted at the same time
2ki823 and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki824 and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
2ki825 in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign
2ki826 two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mother's name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel
2ki827 and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son in law of the house of ahab
2ki828 and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael king of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram
2ki829 and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick
2ki91 and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in thine hand and go to ramothgilead
2ki92 and when thou comest thither look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber
2ki93 then take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then open the door and flee and tarry not
2ki94 so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramothgilead
2ki95 and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto which of all us and he said to thee o captain
2ki96 and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel
2ki97 and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel
2ki98 for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel
2ki99 and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah
2ki910 and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled
2ki911 then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he said unto them ye know the man and his communication
2ki912 and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus and thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel
2ki913 then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying jehu is king
2ki914 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel because of hazael king of syria
2ki915 but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of syria and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel
2ki916 so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram
2ki917 and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace
2ki918 so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he cometh not again
2ki919 then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me
2ki920 and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh not again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he driveth furiously
2ki921 and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite
2ki922 and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many
2ki923 and joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o ahaziah
2ki924 and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehoram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot
2ki925 then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord laid this burden upon him
2ki926 surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will requite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord
2ki927 but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which is by ibleam and he fled to megiddo and died there
2ki928 and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david
2ki929 and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah
2ki930 and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window
2ki931 and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace who slew his master
2ki932 and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs
2ki933 and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode her under foot
2ki934 and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a king's daughter
2ki935 and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands
2ki936 wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel
2ki937 and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel
2ki101 and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up ahab's children saying
2ki102 now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your master's sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and armour
2ki103 look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house
2ki104 but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings stood not before him how then shall we stand
2ki105 and he that was over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any king do thou that which is good in thine eyes
2ki106 then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your master's sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this time now the king's sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city which brought them up
2ki107 and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the king's sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to jezreel
2ki108 and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the king's sons and he said lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning
2ki109 and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who slew all these
2ki1010 know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah
2ki1011 so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he left him none remaining
2ki1012 and he arose and departed and came to samaria and as he was at the shearing house in the way
2ki1013 jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen
2ki1014 and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither left he any of them
2ki1015 and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is if it be give me thine hand and he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot
2ki1016 and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so they made him ride in his chariot
2ki1017 and when he came to samaria he slew all that remained unto ahab in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the lord which he spake to elijah
2ki1018 and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them ahab served baal a little but jehu shall serve him much
2ki1019 now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his servants and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great sacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal
2ki1020 and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and they proclaimed it
2ki1021 and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of baal came so that there was not a man left that came not and they came into the house of baal and the house of baal was full from one end to another
2ki1022 and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forth vestments
2ki1023 and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house of baal and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the worshippers of baal only
2ki1024 and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings jehu appointed fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom i have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his life shall be for the life of him
2ki1025 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains go in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal
2ki1026 and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal and burned them
2ki1027 and they brake down the image of baal and brake down the house of baal and made it a draught house unto this day
2ki1028 thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel
2ki1029 howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden calves that were in bethel and that were in dan
2ki1030 and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel
2ki1031 but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam which made israel to sin
2ki1032 in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazael smote them in all the coasts of israel
2ki1033 from jordan eastward all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer which is by the river arnon even gilead and bashan
2ki1034 now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1035 and jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead
2ki1036 and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty and eight years
2ki111 and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal
2ki112 but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bedchamber from athaliah so that he was not slain
2ki113 and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years and athaliah did reign over the land
2ki114 and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him into the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the king's son
2ki115 and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house
2ki116 and a third part shall be at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down
2ki117 and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king
2ki118 and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in
2ki119 and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest
2ki1110 and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king david's spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord
2ki1111 and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple along by the altar and the temple
2ki1112 and he brought forth the king's son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said god save the king
2ki1113 and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the temple of the lord
2ki1114 and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason
2ki1115 but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth without the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for the priest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord
2ki1116 and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house and there was she slain
2ki1117 and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they should be the lord's people between the king also and the people
2ki1118 and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord
2ki1119 and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house and he sat on the throne of the kings
2ki1120 and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the king's house
2ki1121 seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign
2ki121 in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and forty years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother's name was zibiah of beersheba
2ki122 and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him
2ki123 but the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places
2ki124 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the lord
2ki125 let the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found
2ki126 but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house
2ki127 then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the house
2ki128 and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people neither to repair the breaches of the house
2ki129 but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord
2ki1210 and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the king's scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the lord
2ki1211 and they gave the money being told into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of the lord
2ki1212 and to masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it
2ki1213 howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of silver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of silver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord
2ki1214 but they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith the house of the lord
2ki1215 moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealt faithfully
2ki1216 the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the lord it was the priests'
2ki1217 then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem
2ki1218 and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the lord and in the king's house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from jerusalem
2ki1219 and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1220 and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew joash in the house of millo which goeth down to silla
2ki1221 for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his stead
2ki131 in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned seventeen years
2ki132 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom
2ki133 and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael all their days
2ki134 and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of israel because the king of syria oppressed them
2ki135 and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime
2ki136 nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of jeroboam who made israel sin but walked therein and there remained the grove also in samaria
2ki137 neither did he leave of the people to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of syria had destroyed them and had made them like the dust by threshing
2ki138 now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki139 and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead
2ki1310 in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and reigned sixteen years
2ki1311 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel sin but he walked therein
2ki1312 and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1313 and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throne and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel
2ki1314 now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof
2ki1315 and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows
2ki1316 and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the king's hands
2ki1317 and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them
2ki1318 and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed
2ki1319 and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice
2ki1320 and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year
2ki1321 and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet
2ki1322 but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz
2ki1323 and the lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on them and had respect unto them because of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them from his presence as yet
2ki1324 so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in his stead
2ki1325 and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war three times did joash beat him and recovered the cities of israel
2ki141 in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah
2ki142 he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jehoaddan of jerusalem
2ki143 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord yet not like david his father he did according to all things as joash his father did
2ki144 howbeit the high places were not taken away as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places
2ki145 and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father
2ki146 but the children of the murderers he slew not according unto that which is written in the book of the law of moses wherein the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every man shall be put to death for his own sin
2ki147 he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took selah by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day
2ki148 then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face
2ki149 and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle
2ki1410 thou hast indeed smitten edom and thine heart hath lifted thee up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee
2ki1411 but amaziah would not hear therefore jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah
2ki1412 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to their tents
2ki1413 and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash the son of ahaziah at bethshemesh and came to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubits
2ki1414 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king's house and hostages and returned to samaria
2ki1415 now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might and how he fought with amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1416 and jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead
2ki1417 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years
2ki1418 and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1419 now they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and slew him there
2ki1420 and they brought him on horses and he was buried at jerusalem with his fathers in the city of david
2ki1421 and all the people of judah took azariah which was sixteen years old and made him king instead of his father amaziah
2ki1422 he built elath and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers
2ki1423 in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria and reigned forty and one years
2ki1424 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
2ki1425 he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto the sea of the plain according to the word of the lord god of israel which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah the son of amittai the prophet which was of gathhepher
2ki1426 for the lord saw the affliction of israel that it was very bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper for israel
2ki1427 and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son of joash
2ki1428 now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all that he did and his might how he warred and how he recovered damascus and hamath which belonged to judah for israel are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1429 and jeroboam slept with his fathers even with the kings of israel and zachariah his son reigned in his stead
2ki151 in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign
2ki152 sixteen years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned two and fifty years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jecholiah of jerusalem
2ki153 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father amaziah had done
2ki154 save that the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places
2ki155 and the lord smote the king so that he was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house and jotham the king's son was over the house judging the people of the land
2ki156 and the rest of the acts of azariah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki157 so azariah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and jotham his son reigned in his stead
2ki158 in the thirty and eighth year of azariah king of judah did zachariah the son of jeroboam reign over israel in samaria six months
2ki159 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his fathers had done he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
2ki1510 and shallum the son of jabesh conspired against him and smote him before the people and slew him and reigned in his stead
2ki1511 and the rest of the acts of zachariah behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1512 this was the word of the lord which he spake unto jehu saying thy sons shall sit on the throne of israel unto the fourth generation and so it came to pass
2ki1513 shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah and he reigned a full month in samaria
2ki1514 for menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to samaria and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria and slew him and reigned in his stead
2ki1515 and the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he made behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1516 then menahem smote tiphsah and all that were therein and the coasts thereof from tirzah because they opened not to him therefore he smote it and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up
2ki1517 in the nine and thirtieth year of azariah king of judah began menahem the son of gadi to reign over israel and reigned ten years in samaria
2ki1518 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not all his days from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
2ki1519 and pul the king of assyria came against the land and menahem gave pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand
2ki1520 and menahem exacted the money of israel even of all the mighty men of wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give to the king of assyria so the king of assyria turned back and stayed not there in the land
2ki1521 and the rest of the acts of menahem and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1522 and menahem slept with his fathers and pekahiah his son reigned in his stead
2ki1523 in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son of menahem began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned two years
2ki1524 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
2ki1525 but pekah the son of remaliah a captain of his conspired against him and smote him in samaria in the palace of the king's house with argob and arieh and with him fifty men of the gileadites and he killed him and reigned in his room
2ki1526 and the rest of the acts of pekahiah and all that he did behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1527 in the two and fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekah the son of remaliah began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned twenty years
2ki1528 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
2ki1529 in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglathpileser king of assyria and took ijon and abelbethmaachah and janoah and kedesh and hazor and gilead and galilee all the land of naphtali and carried them captive to assyria
2ki1530 and hoshea the son of elah made a conspiracy against pekah the son of remaliah and smote him and slew him and reigned in his stead in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah
2ki1531 and the rest of the acts of pekah and all that he did behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1532 in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel began jotham the son of uzziah king of judah to reign
2ki1533 five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jerusha the daughter of zadok
2ki1534 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he did according to all that his father uzziah had done
2ki1535 howbeit the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places he built the higher gate of the house of the lord
2ki1536 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1537 in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah
2ki1538 and jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and ahaz his son reigned in his stead
2ki161 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign
2ki162 twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and did not that which was right in the sight of the lord his god like david his father
2ki163 but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel
2ki164 and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
2ki165 then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him
2ki166 at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drave the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt there unto this day
2ki167 so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel which rise up against me
2ki168 and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king's house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria
2ki169 and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin
2ki1610 and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria and saw an altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereof
2ki1611 and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it against king ahaz came from damascus
2ki1612 and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon
2ki1613 and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar
2ki1614 and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar
2ki1615 and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat offering and the king's burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by
2ki1616 thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz commanded
2ki1617 and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stones
2ki1618 and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the king's entry without turned he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria
2ki1619 now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1620 and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead
2ki171 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years
2ki172 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not as the kings of israel that were before him
2ki173 against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and gave him presents
2ki174 and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison
2ki175 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years
2ki176 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes
2ki177 for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods
2ki178 and walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they had made
2ki179 and the children of israel did secretly those things that were not right against the lord their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
2ki1710 and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree
2ki1711 and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger
2ki1712 for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing
2ki1713 yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by all the prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets
2ki1714 notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lord their god
2ki1715 and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the heathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord had charged them that they should not do like them
2ki1716 and they left all the commandments of the lord their god and made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal
2ki1717 and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
2ki1718 therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only
2ki1719 also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they made
2ki1720 and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight
2ki1721 for he rent israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from following the lord and made them sin a great sin
2ki1722 for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them
2ki1723 until the lord removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants the prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day
2ki1724 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof
2ki1725 and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them which slew some of them
2ki1726 wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land
2ki1727 then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land
2ki1728 then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the lord
2ki1729 howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt
2ki1730 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima
2ki1731 and the avites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim
2ki1732 so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places
2ki1733 they feared the lord and served their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence
2ki1734 unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel
2ki1735 with whom the lord had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them
2ki1736 but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice
2ki1737 and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other gods
2ki1738 and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods
2ki1739 but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies
2ki1740 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner
2ki1741 so these nations feared the lord and served their graven images both their children and their children's children as did their fathers so do they unto this day
2ki181 now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign
2ki182 twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem his mother's name also was abi the daughter of zachariah
2ki183 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did
2ki184 he removed the high places and brake the images and cut down the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nehushtan
2ki185 he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him
2ki186 for he clave to the lord and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses
2ki187 and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not
2ki188 he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
2ki189 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it
2ki1810 and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth year of hezekiah that is the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken
2ki1811 and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes
2ki1812 because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them
2ki1813 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took them
2ki1814 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
2ki1815 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king's house
2ki1816 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria
2ki1817 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fuller's field
2ki1818 and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder
2ki1819 and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest
2ki1820 thou sayest but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me
2ki1821 now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him
2ki1822 but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem
2ki1823 now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them
2ki1824 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen
2ki1825 am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it the lord said to me go up against this land and destroy it
2ki1826 then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall
2ki1827 but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you
2ki1828 then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria
2ki1829 thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand
2ki1830 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
2ki1831 hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern
2ki1832 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us
2ki1833 hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria
2ki1834 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and ivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand
2ki1835 who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand
2ki1836 but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the king's commandment was saying answer him not
2ki1837 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh
2ki191 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord
2ki192 and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
2ki193 and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth
2ki194 it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left
2ki195 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
2ki196 and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me
2ki197 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land
2ki198 so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish
2ki199 and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying
2ki1910 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
2ki1911 behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
2ki1912 have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in thelasar
2ki1913 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivah
2ki1914 and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord and spread it before the lord
2ki1915 and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth
2ki1916 lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living god
2ki1917 of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands
2ki1918 and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them
2ki1919 now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only
2ki1920 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard
2ki1921 this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee
2ki1922 whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel
2ki1923 by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel
2ki1924 i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places
2ki1925 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps
2ki1926 therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted before it be grown up
2ki1927 but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me
2ki1928 because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest
2ki1929 and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof
2ki1930 and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward
2ki1931 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this
2ki1932 therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against it
2ki1933 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord
2ki1934 for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake
2ki1935 and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses
2ki1936 so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh
2ki1937 and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead
2ki201 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live
2ki202 then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying
2ki203 i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
2ki204 and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying
2ki205 turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord
2ki206 and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake
2ki207 and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered
2ki208 and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day
2ki209 and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees
2ki2010 and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees
2ki2011 and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz
2ki2012 at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick
2ki2013 and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not
2ki2014 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon
2ki2015 and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them
2ki2016 and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord
2ki2017 behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord
2ki2018 and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon
2ki2019 then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and truth be in my days
2ki2020 and the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2021 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead
2ki211 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem and his mother's name was hephzibah
2ki212 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the children of israel
2ki213 for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them
2ki214 and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord said in jerusalem will i put my name
2ki215 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord
2ki216 and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
2ki217 and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes of israel will i put my name for ever
2ki218 neither will i make the feet of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them
2ki219 but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel
2ki2110 and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying
2ki2111 because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before him and hath made judah also to sin with his idols
2ki2112 therefore thus saith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil upon jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingle
2ki2113 and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down
2ki2114 and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
2ki2115 because they have done that which was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day
2ki2116 moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord
2ki2117 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2118 and manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead
2ki2119 amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem and his mother's name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah
2ki2120 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his father manasseh did
2ki2121 and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped them
2ki2122 and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the way of the lord
2ki2123 and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own house
2ki2124 and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead
2ki2125 now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2126 and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his stead
2ki221 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of boscath
2ki222 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left
2ki223 and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying
2ki224 go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people
2ki225 and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to repair the breaches of the house
2ki226 unto carpenters and builders and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house
2ki227 howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully
2ki228 and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan and he read it
2ki229 and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord
2ki2210 and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king
2ki2211 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes
2ki2212 and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe and asahiah a servant of the king's saying
2ki2213 go ye enquire of the lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning us
2ki2214 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they communed with her
2ki2215 and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell the man that sent you to me
2ki2216 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read
2ki2217 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched
2ki2218 but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard
2ki2219 because thine heart was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thou heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord
2ki2220 behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought the king word again
2ki231 and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem
2ki232 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord
2ki233 and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant
2ki234 and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel
2ki235 and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the host of heaven
2ki236 and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord without jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people
2ki237 and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove
2ki238 and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from geba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city
2ki239 nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren
2ki2310 and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech
2ki2311 and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the chariots of the sun with fire
2ki2312 and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beat down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron
2ki2313 and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians and for chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile
2ki2314 and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and filled their places with the bones of men
2ki2315 moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both that altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the grove
2ki2316 and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these words
2ki2317 then he said what title is that that i see and the men of the city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came from judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel
2ki2318 and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria
2ki2319 and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel
2ki2320 and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned men's bones upon them and returned to jerusalem
2ki2321 and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover unto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant
2ki2322 surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah
2ki2323 but in the eighteenth year of king josiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem
2ki2324 moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord
2ki2325 and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him
2ki2326 notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal
2ki2327 and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there
2ki2328 now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2329 in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him and he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him
2ki2330 and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in his father's stead
2ki2331 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mother's name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
2ki2332 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done
2ki2333 and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
2ki2334 and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there
2ki2335 and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnechoh
2ki2336 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother's name was zebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah
2ki2337 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done
2ki241 in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him
2ki242 and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees and bands of the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of the lord which he spake by his servants the prophets
2ki243 surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did
2ki244 and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not pardon
2ki245 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki246 so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead
2ki247 and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt
2ki248 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem three months and his mother's name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem
2ki249 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his father had done
2ki2410 at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against jerusalem and the city was besieged
2ki2411 and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city and his servants did besiege it
2ki2412 and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign
2ki2413 and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord as the lord had said
2ki2414 and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land
2ki2415 and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the king's mother and the king's wives and his officers and the mighty of the land those carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon
2ki2416 and all the men of might even seven thousand and craftsmen and smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon
2ki2417 and the king of babylon made mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah
2ki2418 zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother's name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
2ki2419 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done
2ki2420 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon
2ki251 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his host against jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round about
2ki252 and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah
2ki253 and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land
2ki254 and the city was broken up and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the king's garden now the chaldees were against the city round about and the king went the way toward the plain
2ki255 and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of jericho and all his army were scattered from him
2ki256 so they took the king and brought him up to the king of babylon to riblah and they gave judgment upon him
2ki257 and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to babylon
2ki258 and in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon unto jerusalem
2ki259 and he burnt the house of the lord and the king's house and all the houses of jerusalem and every great man's house burnt he with fire
2ki2510 and all the army of the chaldees that were with the captain of the guard brake down the walls of jerusalem round about
2ki2511 now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon with the remnant of the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away
2ki2512 but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen
2ki2513 and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord did the chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to babylon
2ki2514 and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away
2ki2515 and the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away
2ki2516 the two pillars one sea and the bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
2ki2517 the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work
2ki2518 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door
2ki2519 and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and five men of them that were in the king's presence which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city
2ki2520 and nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah
2ki2521 and the king of babylon smote them and slew them at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was carried away out of their land
2ki2522 and as for the people that remained in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler
2ki2523 and when all the captains of the armies they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor there came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of careah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men
2ki2524 and gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto them fear not to be the servants of the chaldees dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you
2ki2525 but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten men with him and smote gedaliah that he died and the jews and the chaldees that were with him at mizpah
2ki2526 and all the people both small and great and the captains of the armies arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldees
2ki2527 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison
2ki2528 and he spake kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon
2ki2529 and changed his prison garments and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life
2ki2530 and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king a daily rate for every day all the days of his life

1chr101 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa
1chr102 and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul
1chr103 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was wounded of the archers
1chr104 then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a sword and fell upon it
1chr105 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise on the sword and died
1chr106 so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together
1chr107 and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that they fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them
1chr108 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa
1chr109 and when they had stripped him they took his head and his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry tidings unto their idols and to the people
1chr1010 and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of dagon
1chr1011 and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul
1chr1012 they arose all the valiant men and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days
1chr1013 so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire of it
1chr1014 and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse
1chr111 then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
1chr112 and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel
1chr113 therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the lord by samuel
1chr114 and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land
1chr115 and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come hither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the city of david
1chr116 and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and was chief
1chr117 and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city of david
1chr118 and he built the city round about even from millo round about and joab repaired the rest of the city
1chr119 so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was with him
1chr1110 these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel
1chr1111 and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time
1chr1112 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighties
1chr1113 he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines
1chr1114 and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a great deliverance
1chr1115 now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped in the valley of rephaim
1chr1116 and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrison was then at bethlehem
1chr1117 and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate
1chr1118 and the three brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured it out to the lord
1chr1119 and said my god forbid it me that i should do this thing shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mightiest
1chr1120 and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for lifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had a name among the three
1chr1121 of the three he was more honourable than the two for he was their captain howbeit he attained not to the first three
1chr1122 benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day
1chr1123 and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian's hand and slew him with his own spear
1chr1124 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among the three mighties
1chr1125 behold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard

1chr1215 these are they that went over jordan in the first month when it had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the west
1chr1216 and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold unto david
1chr1217 and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it
1chr1218 then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the captains and he said thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy god helpeth thee then david received them and made them captains of the band
1chr1219 and there fell some of manasseh to david when he came with the philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he will fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads
1chr1220 as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zilthai captains of the thousands that were of manasseh
1chr1221 and they helped david against the band of the rovers for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host
1chr1222 for at that time day by day there came to david to help him until it was a great host like the host of god
1chr1223 and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war and came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to him according to the word of the lord
1chr1224 the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war
1chr1225 of the children of simeon mighty men of valour for the war seven thousand and one hundred
1chr1226 of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred
1chr1227 and jehoiada was the leader of the aaronites and with him were three thousand and seven hundred
1chr1228 and zadok a young man mighty of valour and of his father's house twenty and two captains
1chr1229 and of the children of benjamin the kindred of saul three thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of saul
1chr1230 and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their fathers
1chr1231 and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which were expressed by name to come and make david king
1chr1232 and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment
1chr1233 of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heart
1chr1234 and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand

1chr1238 all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king
1chr1239 and there they were with david three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them
1chr1240 moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there was joy in israel
1chr131 and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader
1chr132 and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seem good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us
1chr133 and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquired not at it in the days of saul
1chr134 and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people
1chr135 so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt even unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god from kirjathjearim
1chr136 and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it
1chr137 and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart
1chr138 and david and all israel played before god with all their might and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets
1chr139 and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled
1chr1310 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god
1chr1311 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day
1chr1312 and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me
1chr1313 so david brought not the ark home to himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite
1chr1314 and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had
1chr141 now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house
1chr142 and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people israel
1chr143 and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons and daughters
1chr144 now these are the names of his children which he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon
1chr145 and ibhar and elishua and elpalet
1chr146 and nogah and nepheg and japhia
1chr147 and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet
1chr148 and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out against them
1chr149 and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim
1chr1410 and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand
1chr1411 so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there then david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim
1chr1412 and when they had left their gods there david gave a commandment and they were burned with fire
1chr1413 and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley
1chr1414 therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
1chr1415 and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines
1chr1416 david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer
1chr1417 and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations
1chr151 and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent
1chr152 then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to minister unto him for ever
1chr153 and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it
1chr154 and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites
1chr155 of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred and twenty
1chr156 of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twenty
1chr157 of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty

1chr159 of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore
1chr1510 of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren an hundred and twelve
1chr1511 and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab
1chr1512 and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it
1chr1513 for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order
1chr1514 so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel
1chr1515 and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord
1chr1516 and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy
1chr1517 so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah
1chr1518 and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the porters
1chr1519 so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass
1chr1520 and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries on alamoth
1chr1521 and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps on the sheminith to excel
1chr1522 and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed about the song because he was skilful
1chr1523 and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark
1chr1524 and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark
1chr1525 so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy
1chr1526 and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams
1chr1527 and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of linen
1chr1528 thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps
1chr1529 and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart
1chr161 so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god
1chr162 and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord
1chr163 and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine
1chr164 and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel
1chr165 asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a sound with cymbals
1chr166 benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god
1chr167 then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren
1chr168 give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people
1chr169 sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works
1chr1610 glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord
1chr1611 seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually
1chr1612 remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth
1chr1613 o ye seed of israel his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones
1chr1614 he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
1chr1615 be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generations
1chr1616 even of the covenant which he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac
1chr1617 and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant
1chr1618 saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance
1chr1619 when ye were but few even a few and strangers in it
1chr1620 and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people
1chr1621 he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes
1chr1622 saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm
1chr1623 sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day his salvation
1chr1624 declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among all nations
1chr1625 for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods
1chr1626 for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens
1chr1627 glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place
1chr1628 give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength
1chr1629 give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness
1chr1630 fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved
1chr1631 let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men say among the nations the lord reigneth
1chr1632 let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein
1chr1633 then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord because he cometh to judge the earth
1chr1634 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
1chr1635 and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise
1chr1636 blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all the people said amen and praised the lord
1chr1637 so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every day's work required
1chr1638 and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters
1chr1639 and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon
1chr1640 to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel
1chr1641 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever
1chr1642 and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthun were porters
1chr1643 and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house
1chr171 now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains
1chr172 then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee
1chr173 and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying
1chr174 go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in
1chr175 for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another
1chr176 wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have ye not built me an house of cedars
1chr177 now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel
1chr178 and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth
1chr179 also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the beginning
1chr1710 and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemies furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house
1chr1711 and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom
1chr1712 he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for ever
1chr1713 i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before thee
1chr1714 but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for evermore
1chr1715 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david
1chr1716 and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hitherto
1chr1717 and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree o lord god
1chr1718 what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant for thou knowest thy servant
1chr1719 o lord for thy servant's sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these great things
1chr1720 o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears
1chr1721 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt
1chr1722 for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord becamest their god
1chr1723 therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said
1chr1724 let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before thee
1chr1725 for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee
1chr1726 and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant
1chr1727 now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever
1chr181 now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines
1chr182 and he smote moab and the moabites became david's servants and brought gifts
1chr183 and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates
1chr184 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots
1chr185 and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men
1chr186 then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became david's servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
1chr187 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem
1chr188 likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass
1chr189 now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah
1chr1810 he sent hadoram his son to king david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war with tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass
1chr1811 them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek
1chr1812 moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand
1chr1813 and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became david's servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
1chr1814 so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people
1chr1815 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud recorder
1chr1816 and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and shavsha was scribe
1chr1817 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king
1chr191 now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead
1chr192 and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants of david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him
1chr193 but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land
1chr194 wherefore hanun took david's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them away
1chr195 then there went certain and told david how the men were served and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return
1chr196 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah
1chr197 so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle
1chr198 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men
1chr199 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field
1chr1910 now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in array against the syrians
1chr1911 and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of ammon
1chr1912 and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee
1chr1913 be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that which is good in his sight
1chr1914 so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle and they fled before him
1chr1915 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city then joab came to jerusalem
1chr1916 and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them
1chr1917 and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him
1chr1918 but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host
1chr1919 and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and became his servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more
1chr201 and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and destroyed it
1chr202 and david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon david's head and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city
1chr203 and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the people returned to jerusalem
1chr204 and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued
1chr205 and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam
1chr206 and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant
1chr207 but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea david's brother slew him
1chr208 these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants
1chr211 and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel
1chr212 and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them to me that i may know it
1chr213 and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lord's servants why then doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of trespass to israel
1chr214 nevertheless the king's word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem
1chr215 and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword
1chr216 but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the king's word was abominable to joab
1chr217 and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel
1chr218 and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly
1chr219 and the lord spake unto gad david's seer saying
1chr2110 go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee
1chr2111 so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord choose thee
1chr2112 either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to him that sent me
1chr2113 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man
1chr2114 so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men
1chr2115 and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
1chr2116 and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces
1chr2117 and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee o lord my god be on me and on my father's house but not on thy people that they should be plagued
1chr2118 then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
1chr2119 and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the name of the lord
1chr2120 and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat
1chr2121 and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground
1chr2122 then david said to ornan grant me the place of this threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people
1chr2123 and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering i give it all
1chr2124 and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost
1chr2125 so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight
1chr2126 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering
1chr2127 and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof
1chr2128 at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there
1chr2129 for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon
1chr2130 but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord
1chr221 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel
1chr222 and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god
1chr223 and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weight
1chr224 also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david
1chr225 and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death
1chr226 then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel
1chr227 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god
1chr228 but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight
1chr229 behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days
1chr2210 he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever
1chr2211 now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee
1chr2212 only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god
1chr2213 then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed
1chr2214 now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto
1chr2215 moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work
1chr2216 of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee
1chr2217 david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying
1chr2218 is not the lord your god with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and before his people
1chr2219 now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord
1chr231 so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son king over israel
1chr232 and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites
1chr233 now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand
1chr234 of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges
1chr235 moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made said david to praise therewith
1chr236 and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi namely gershon kohath and merari
1chr237 of the gershonites were laadan and shimei
1chr238 the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joel three
1chr239 the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three these were the chief of the fathers of laadan
1chr2310 and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei
1chr2311 and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning according to their father's house
1chr2312 the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four
1chr2313 the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for ever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name for ever
1chr2314 now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of the tribe of levi
1chr2315 the sons of moses were gershom and eliezer
1chr2316 of the sons of gershom shebuel was the chief
1chr2317 and the sons of eliezer were rehabiah the chief and eliezer had none other sons but the sons of rehabiah were very many
1chr2318 of the sons of izhar shelomith the chief
1chr2319 of the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth
1chr2320 of the sons of uzziel micah the first and jesiah the second
1chr2321 the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of mahli eleazar and kish
1chr2322 and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their brethren the sons of kish took them
1chr2323 the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three
1chr2324 these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the lord from the age of twenty years and upward
1chr2325 for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his people that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever
1chr2326 and also unto the levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels of it for the service thereof
1chr2327 for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from twenty years old and above
1chr2328 because their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of god
1chr2329 both for the shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that which is fried and for all manner of measure and size
1chr2330 and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise at even
1chr2331 and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the sabbaths in the new moons and on the set feasts by number according to the order commanded unto them continually before the lord
1chr2332 and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the lord
1chr241 now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
1chr242 but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priest's office
1chr243 and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices in their service
1chr244 and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons of eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers
1chr245 thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for the governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar
1chr246 and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe one of the levites wrote them before the king and the princes and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites one principal household being taken for eleazar and one taken for ithamar
1chr247 now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib the second to jedaiah
1chr248 the third to harim the fourth to seorim
1chr249 the fifth to malchijah the sixth to mijamin
1chr2410 the seventh to hakkoz the eighth to abijah
1chr2411 the ninth to jeshuah the tenth to shecaniah
1chr2412 the eleventh to eliashib the twelfth to jakim
1chr2413 the thirteenth to huppah the fourteenth to jeshebeab
1chr2414 the fifteenth to bilgah the sixteenth to immer
1chr2415 the seventeenth to hezir the eighteenth to aphses

1chr282 then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and had made ready for the building
1chr283 but god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood
1chr284 howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to be the ruler and of the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all israel
1chr285 and of all my sons for the lord hath given me many sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel
1chr286 and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his father
1chr287 moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day
1chr288 now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever
1chr289 and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for ever
1chr2810 take heed now for the lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary be strong and do it
1chr2811 then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlours thereof and of the place of the mercy seat
1chr2812 and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of the courts of the house of the lord and of all the chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of god and of the treasuries of the dedicated things

1chr2818 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the lord
1chr2819 all this said david the lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern
1chr2820 and david said to solomon his son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the lord god even my god will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the lord
1chr2821 and behold the courses of the priests and the levites even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of god and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment
1chr291 furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord god
1chr292 now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance
1chr293 moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god i have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which i have given to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house
1chr294 even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses withal
1chr295 the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord
1chr296 then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly
1chr297 and gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of iron
1chr298 and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jehiel the gershonite
1chr299 then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy
1chr2910 wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father for ever and ever
1chr2911 thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all
1chr2912 both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all
1chr2913 now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name
1chr2914 but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee
1chr2915 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding
1chr2916 o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all thine own
1chr2917 i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee
1chr2918 o lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee
1chr2919 and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for the which i have made provision
1chr2920 and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your god and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king
1chr2921 and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel
1chr2922 and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest
1chr2923 then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him
1chr2924 and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king
1chr2925 and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel
1chr2926 thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel
1chr2927 and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem
1chr2928 and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour and solomon his son reigned in his stead
1chr2929 now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the prophet and in the book of gad the seer
1chr2930 with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries
2chr11 and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly
2chr12 then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all israel the chief of the fathers
2chr13 so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at gibeon for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in the wilderness
2chr14 but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to the place which david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem
2chr15 moreover the brasen altar that bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the lord and solomon and the congregation sought unto it
2chr16 and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord which was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it
2chr17 in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask what i shall give thee
2chr18 and solomon said unto god thou hast shewed great mercy unto david my father and hast made me to reign in his stead
2chr19 now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude
2chr110 give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great
2chr111 and god said to solomon because this was in thine heart and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of thine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom i have made thee king
2chr112 wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like
2chr113 then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at gibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation and reigned over israel
2chr114 and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem
2chr115 and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance
2chr116 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
2chr117 and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria by their means
2chr21 and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord and an house for his kingdom
2chr22 and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them
2chr23 and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein even so deal with me
2chr24 behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the lord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel
2chr25 and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods
2chr26 but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him
2chr27 send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father did provide
2chr28 send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of lebanon for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants
2chr29 even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be wonderful great
2chr210 and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil
2chr211 then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made thee king over them
2chr212 huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the lord and an house for his kingdom
2chr213 and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of huram my father's
2chr214 the son of a woman of the daughters of dan and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father
2chr215 now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants
2chr216 and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem
2chr217 and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred
2chr218 and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work
2chr31 then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
2chr32 and he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign
2chr33 now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits
2chr34 and the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold
2chr35 and the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains
2chr36 and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim
2chr37 he overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the walls
2chr38 and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents
2chr39 and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold
2chr310 and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work and overlaid them with gold
2chr311 and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub
2chr312 and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherub
2chr313 the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward
2chr314 and he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereon
2chr315 also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits
2chr316 and he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains
2chr317 and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz
2chr41 moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereof
2chr42 also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
2chr43 and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about two rows of oxen were cast when it was cast
2chr44 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward
2chr45 and the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it received and held three thousand baths
2chr46 he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in
2chr47 and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left
2chr48 he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left and he made an hundred basons of gold
2chr49 furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass
2chr410 and he set the sea on the right side of the east end over against the south
2chr411 and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons and huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the house of god
2chr412 to wit the two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars
2chr413 and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars
2chr414 he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases
2chr415 one sea and twelve oxen under it
2chr416 the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their instruments did huram his father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass
2chr417 in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah
2chr418 thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out
2chr419 and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set
2chr420 moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn after the manner before the oracle of pure gold
2chr421 and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that perfect gold
2chr422 and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of the temple were of gold
2chr51 thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of god
2chr52 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion
2chr53 wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month
2chr54 and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark
2chr55 and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle these did the priests and the levites bring up
2chr56 also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude
2chr57 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims
2chr58 for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
2chr59 and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day
2chr510 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt
2chr511 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course
2chr512 also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets
2chr513 it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord
2chr514 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god
2chr61 then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
2chr62 but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever
2chr63 and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood
2chr64 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david saying
2chr65 since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel
2chr66 but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel
2chr67 now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel
2chr68 but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in thine heart
2chr69 notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name
2chr610 the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel
2chr611 and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel
2chr612 and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands
2chr613 for solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
2chr614 and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts
2chr615 thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day
2chr616 now therefore o lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me
2chr617 now then o lord god of israel let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant david
2chr618 but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have built
2chr619 have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee
2chr620 that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place
2chr621 hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive
2chr622 if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house
2chr623 then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness
2chr624 and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house
2chr625 then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers
2chr626 when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict them
2chr627 then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou hast taught them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance
2chr628 if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be
2chr629 then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and shall spread forth his hands in this house
2chr630 then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men
2chr631 that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
2chr632 moreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people israel but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake and thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in this house
2chr633 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as doth thy people israel and may know that this house which i have built is called by thy name
2chr634 if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name
2chr635 then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause
2chr636 if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near
2chr637 yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt wickedly
2chr638 if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name
2chr639 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee
2chr640 now my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
2chr641 now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness
2chr642 o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember the mercies of david thy servant
2chr71 now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house
2chr72 and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord because the glory of the lord had filled the lord's house
2chr73 and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
2chr74 then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord
2chr75 and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god
2chr76 and the priests waited on their offices the levites also with instruments of musick of the lord which david the king had made to praise the lord because his mercy endureth for ever when david praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before them and all israel stood
2chr77 moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat offerings and the fat
2chr78 also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days and all israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt
2chr79 and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days
2chr710 and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the lord had shewed unto david and to solomon and to israel his people
2chr711 thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the king's house and all that came into solomon's heart to make in the house of the lord and in his own house he prosperously effected
2chr712 and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice
2chr713 if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people
2chr714 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
2chr715 now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
2chr716 for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
2chr717 and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments
2chr718 then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel
2chr719 but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them
2chr720 then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations
2chr721 and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and unto this house
2chr722 and it shall be answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them
2chr81 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the house of the lord and his own house
2chr82 that the cities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there
2chr83 and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it
2chr84 and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities which he built in hamath
2chr85 also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether fenced cities with walls gates and bars
2chr86 and baalath and all the store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominion
2chr87 as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites which were not of israel
2chr88 but of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day
2chr89 but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and captains of his chariots and horsemen
2chr810 and these were the chief of king solomon's officers even two hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people
2chr811 and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come
2chr812 then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar of the lord which he had built before the porch
2chr813 even after a certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles
2chr814 and he appointed according to the order of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded
2chr815 and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures
2chr816 now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the house of the lord was perfected
2chr817 then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side in the land of edom
2chr818 and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon
2chr91 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart
2chr92 and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not
2chr93 and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built
2chr94 and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
2chr95 and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom
2chr96 howbeit i believed not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou exceedest the fame that i heard
2chr97 happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom
2chr98 blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and justice
2chr99 and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon
2chr910 and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon which brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious stones
2chr911 and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the lord and to the king's palace and harps and psalteries for singers and there were none such seen before in the land of judah
2chr912 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king so she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants
2chr913 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold
2chr914 beside that which chapmen and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon
2chr915 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target
2chr916 and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon
2chr917 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold
2chr918 and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the sitting place and two lions standing by the stays
2chr919 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom
2chr920 and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the days of solomon
2chr921 for the king's ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks
2chr922 and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
2chr923 and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart
2chr924 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules a rate year by year
2chr925 and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem
2chr926 and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt
2chr927 and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance
2chr928 and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all lands
2chr929 now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat
2chr930 and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years
2chr931 and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
2chr101 and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel come to make him king
2chr102 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was in egypt whither he had fled from the presence of solomon the king heard it that jeroboam returned out of egypt
2chr103 and they sent and called him so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam saying
2chr104 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee
2chr105 and he said unto them come again unto me after three days and the people departed
2chr106 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people
2chr107 and they spake unto him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever
2chr108 but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood before him
2chr109 and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us
2chr1010 and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins
2chr1011 for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put more to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
2chr1012 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day
2chr1013 and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men
2chr1014 and answered them after the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
2chr1015 so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat
2chr1016 and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so all israel went to their tents
2chr1017 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them
2chr1018 then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem
2chr1019 and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day
2chr111 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam
2chr112 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying
2chr113 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying
2chr114 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words of the lord and returned from going against jeroboam
2chr115 and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah
2chr116 he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa
2chr117 and bethzur and shoco and adullam
2chr118 and gath and mareshah and ziph
2chr119 and adoraim and lachish and azekah
2chr1110 and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities
2chr1111 and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and store of victual and of oil and wine
2chr1112 and in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side
2chr1113 and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts
2chr1114 for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the lord
2chr1115 and he ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had made
2chr1116 and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers
2chr1117 so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon
2chr1118 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse
2chr1119 which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham
2chr1120 and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith
2chr1121 and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters
2chr1122 and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him king
2chr1123 and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced city and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired many wives
2chr121 and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him
2chr122 and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had transgressed against the lord
2chr123 with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the ethiopians
2chr124 and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came to jerusalem
2chr125 then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak
2chr126 whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous
2chr127 and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak
2chr128 nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries
2chr129 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made
2chr1210 instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the king's house
2chr1211 and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber
2chr1212 and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah things went well
2chr1213 so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess
2chr1214 and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord
2chr1215 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually
2chr1216 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead
2chr131 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah
2chr132 he reigned three years in jerusalem his mother's name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam
2chr133 and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men being mighty men of valour
2chr134 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel
2chr135 ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt
2chr136 yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord
2chr137 and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them
2chr138 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with you golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods
2chr139 have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no gods
2chr1310 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites wait upon their business
2chr1311 and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him
2chr1312 and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper
2chr1313 but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them
2chr1314 and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the trumpets
2chr1315 then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah
2chr1316 and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand
2chr1317 and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men
2chr1318 thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers
2chr1319 and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephrain with the towns thereof
2chr1320 neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and the lord struck him and he died
2chr1321 but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters
2chr1322 and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo
2chr141 so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land was quiet ten years
2chr142 and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god
2chr143 for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves
2chr144 and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment
2chr145 also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him
2chr146 and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest
2chr147 therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and prospered
2chr148 and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valour
2chr149 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto mareshah
2chr1410 then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah
2chr1411 and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let not man prevail against thee
2chr1412 so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled
2chr1413 and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much spoil
2chr1414 and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding much spoil in them
2chr1415 they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem
2chr151 and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded
2chr152 and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you
2chr153 now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law
2chr154 but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them
2chr155 and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries
2chr156 and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did vex them with all adversity
2chr157 be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded
2chr158 and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord
2chr159 and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him
2chr1510 so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa
2chr1511 and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
2chr1512 and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul
2chr1513 that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman
2chr1514 and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets
2chr1515 and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about
2chr1516 and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook kidron
2chr1517 but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days
2chr1518 and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels
2chr1519 and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa
2chr161 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah
2chr162 then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the king's house and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying
2chr163 there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me
2chr164 and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali
2chr165 and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off building of ramah and let his work cease
2chr166 then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was building and he built therewith geba and mizpah
2chr167 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand
2chr168 were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into thine hand
2chr169 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars
2chr1610 then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed some of the people the same time
2chr1611 and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr1612 and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physicians
2chr1613 and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign
2chr1614 and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him
2chr171 and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel
2chr172 and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken
2chr173 and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim
2chr174 but sought to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel
2chr175 therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundance
2chr176 and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah
2chr177 also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to michaiah to teach in the cities of judah
2chr178 and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and jehoram priests
2chr179 and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught the people
2chr1710 and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat
2chr1711 also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats
2chr1712 and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store
2chr1713 and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem
2chr1714 and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand
2chr1715 and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand
2chr1716 and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour
2chr1717 and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand
2chr1718 and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war
2chr1719 these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah
2chr181 now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined affinity with ahab
2chr182 and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead
2chr183 and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war
2chr184 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day
2chr185 therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver it into the king's hand
2chr186 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him
2chr187 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
2chr188 and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla
2chr189 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
2chr1810 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed
2chr1811 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king
2chr1812 and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good
2chr1813 and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith that will i speak
2chr1814 and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand
2chr1815 and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord
2chr1816 then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace
2chr1817 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil
2chr1818 again he said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left
2chr1819 and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner
2chr1820 then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith
2chr1821 and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so
2chr1822 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against thee
2chr1823 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee
2chr1824 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
2chr1825 then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king's son
2chr1826 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace
2chr1827 and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people
2chr1828 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead
2chr1829 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so the king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle
2chr1830 now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of israel
2chr1831 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him
2chr1832 for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again from pursuing him
2chr1833 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for i am wounded
2chr1834 and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he died
2chr191 and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem
2chr192 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before the lord
2chr193 nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek god
2chr194 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers
2chr195 and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah city by city
2chr196 and said to the judges take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment
2chr197 wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts
2chr198 moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to jerusalem
2chr199 and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a perfect heart
2chr1910 and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass
2chr1911 and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah for all the king's matters also the levites shall be officers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good
2chr201 it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle
2chr202 then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi
2chr203 and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah
2chr204 and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord
2chr205 and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court
2chr206 and said o lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee
2chr207 art not thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever
2chr208 and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying
2chr209 if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help
2chr2010 and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not
2chr2011 behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit
2chr2012 o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee
2chr2013 and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children
2chr2014 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation
2chr2015 and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but god's
2chr2016 to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jeruel
2chr2017 ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you
2chr2018 and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshipping the lord
2chr2019 and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high
2chr2020 and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper
2chr2021 and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever
2chr2022 and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten
2chr2023 for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another
2chr2024 and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escaped
2chr2025 and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much
2chr2026 and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day
2chr2027 then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies
2chr2028 and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord
2chr2029 and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel
2chr2030 so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about
2chr2031 and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mother's name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
2chr2032 and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed not from it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord
2chr2033 howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers
2chr2034 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is mentioned in the book of the kings of israel
2chr2035 and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly
2chr2036 and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongaber
2chr2037 then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that they were not able to go to tarshish
2chr211 now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his stead
2chr212 and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel
2chr213 and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn
2chr214 now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel
2chr215 jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem
2chr216 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the lord
2chr217 howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever
2chr218 in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah and made themselves a king
2chr219 then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which compassed him in and the captains of the chariots
2chr2110 so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers
2chr2111 moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled judah thereto
2chr2112 and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah
2chr2113 but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house which were better than thyself
2chr2114 behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods
2chr2115 and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day
2chr2116 moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians
2chr2117 and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons
2chr2118 and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease
2chr2119 and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers
2chr2120 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings
2chr221 and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned
2chr222 forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem his mother's name also was athaliah the daughter of omri
2chr223 he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly
2chr224 wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction
2chr225 he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram
2chr226 and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick
2chr227 and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab
2chr228 and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them
2chr229 and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom
2chr2210 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah
2chr2211 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not
2chr2212 and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land
2chr231 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him
2chr232 and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they came to jerusalem
2chr233 and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god and he said unto them behold the king's son shall reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david
2chr234 this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the doors
2chr235 and a third part shall be at the king's house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord
2chr236 but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord
2chr237 and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out
2chr238 so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses
2chr239 moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king david's which were in the house of god
2chr2310 and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about
2chr2311 then they brought out the king's son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said god save the king
2chr2312 now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord
2chr2313 and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason
2chr2314 then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord
2chr2315 so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house they slew her there
2chr2316 and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the lord's people
2chr2317 then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars
2chr2318 also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by david
2chr2319 and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in
2chr2320 and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the high gate into the king's house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom
2chr2321 and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain athaliah with the sword
2chr241 joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem his mother's name also was zibiah of beersheba
2chr242 and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest
2chr243 and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters
2chr244 and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair the house of the lord
2chr245 and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not
2chr246 and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tabernacle of witness
2chr247 for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim
2chr248 and at the king's commandment they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord
2chr249 and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness
2chr2410 and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end
2chr2411 now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance
2chr2412 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord
2chr2413 so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it
2chr2414 and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada
2chr2415 but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died
2chr2416 and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his house
2chr2417 now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them
2chr2418 and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass
2chr2419 yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear
2chr2420 and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you
2chr2421 and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord
2chr2422 thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it
2chr2423 and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus
2chr2424 for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgment against joash
2chr2425 and when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings
2chr2426 and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess
2chr2427 now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are written in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his son reigned in his stead
2chr251 amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jehoaddan of jerusalem
2chr252 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not with a perfect heart
2chr253 now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father
2chr254 but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin
2chr255 moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield
2chr256 he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver
2chr257 but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit with all the children of ephraim
2chr258 but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down
2chr259 and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this
2chr2510 then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger
2chr2511 and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand
2chr2512 and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in pieces
2chr2513 but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil
2chr2514 now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them
2chr2515 wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand
2chr2516 and it came to pass as he talked with him that the king said unto him art thou made of the king's counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel
2chr2517 then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us see one another in the face
2chr2518 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle
2chr2519 thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee
2chr2520 but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of edom
2chr2521 so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah
2chr2522 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent
2chr2523 and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits
2chr2524 and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the king's house the hostages also and returned to samaria
2chr2525 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years
2chr2526 now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr2527 now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there
2chr2528 and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah
2chr261 then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah
2chr262 he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers
2chr263 sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mother's name also was jecoliah of jerusalem
2chr264 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father amaziah did
2chr265 and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him to prosper
2chr266 and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines
2chr267 and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims
2chr268 and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly
2chr269 moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them
2chr2610 also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel for he loved husbandry
2chr2611 moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah one of the king's captains
2chr2612 the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred
2chr2613 and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy
2chr2614 and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast stones
2chr2615 and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong
2chr2616 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense
2chr2617 and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the lord that were valiant men
2chr2618 and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god
2chr2619 then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar
2chr2620 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him
2chr2621 and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the king's house judging the people of the land
2chr2622 now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah the prophet the son of amoz write
2chr2623 so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead
2chr271 jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem his mother's name also was jerushah the daughter of zadok
2chr272 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly
2chr273 he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall of ophel he built much
2chr274 moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in the forests he built castles and towers
2chr275 he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed against them and the children of ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto him both the second year and the third
2chr276 so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the lord his god
2chr277 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah
2chr278 he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem
2chr279 and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead
2chr281 ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the sight of the lord like david his father
2chr282 for he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim
2chr283 moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel
2chr284 he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
2chr285 wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to damascus and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter
2chr286 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers
2chr287 and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the king's son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next to the king
2chr288 and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria
2chr289 but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven
2chr2810 and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with you even with you sins against the lord your god
2chr2811 now hear me therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you
2chr2812 then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that came from the war
2chr2813 and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lord already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel
2chr2814 so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation
2chr2815 and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to samaria
2chr2816 at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him
2chr2817 for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried away captives
2chr2818 the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and gederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with the villages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt there
2chr2819 for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord
2chr2820 and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not
2chr2821 for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the king of assyria but he helped him not
2chr2822 and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord this is that king ahaz
2chr2823 for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the kings of syria help them therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but they were the ruin of him and of all israel
2chr2824 and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem
2chr2825 and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers
2chr2826 now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr2827 and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead
2chr291 hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mother's name was abijah the daughter of zechariah
2chr292 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father had done
2chr293 he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the lord and repaired them
2chr294 and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the east street
2chr295 and said unto them hear me ye levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place
2chr296 for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their backs
2chr297 also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel
2chr298 wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as ye see with your eyes
2chr299 for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this
2chr2910 now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us
2chr2911 my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incense
2chr2912 then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah
2chr2913 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah
2chr2914 and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel
2chr2915 and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord
2chr2916 and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron
2chr2917 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end
2chr2918 then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereof
2chr2919 moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the lord
2chr2920 then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the lord
2chr2921 and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord
2chr2922 so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar
2chr2923 and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them
2chr2924 and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all israel
2chr2925 and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the king's seer and nathan the prophet for so was the commandment of the lord by his prophets
2chr2926 and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets
2chr2927 and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of israel
2chr2928 and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished
2chr2929 and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped
2chr2930 moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshipped
2chr2931 then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings
2chr2932 and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord
2chr2933 and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep
2chr2934 but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests
2chr2935 and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering so the service of the house of the lord was set in order
2chr2936 and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared the people for the thing was done suddenly
2chr301 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel
2chr302 for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month
2chr303 for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem
2chr304 and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation
2chr305 so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written
2chr306 so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria
2chr307 and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation as ye see
2chr308 now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you
2chr309 for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him
2chr3010 so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them
2chr3011 nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem
2chr3012 also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord
2chr3013 and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation
2chr3014 and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron
2chr3015 then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord
2chr3016 and they stood in their place after their manner according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the levites
2chr3017 for there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord
2chr3018 for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiah prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one
2chr3019 that prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary
2chr3020 and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people
2chr3021 and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud instruments unto the lord
2chr3022 and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the lord god of their fathers
2chr3023 and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness
2chr3024 for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves
2chr3025 and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced
2chr3026 so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem
2chr3027 then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place even unto heaven
2chr311 now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities
2chr312 and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses every man according to his service the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord
2chr313 he appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord
2chr314 moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord
2chr315 and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly
2chr316 and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps
2chr317 in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month
2chr318 and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the lord and his people israel
2chr319 then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps
2chr3110 and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store
2chr3111 then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord and they prepared them
2chr3112 and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next
2chr3113 and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god
2chr3114 and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the oblations of the lord and the most holy things
2chr3115 and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small
2chr3116 beside their genealogy of males from three years old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses
2chr3117 both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their courses
2chr3118 and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness
2chr3119 also of the sons of aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites
2chr3120 and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god
2chr3121 and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered
2chr321 after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himself
2chr322 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem
2chr323 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him
2chr324 so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water
2chr325 also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance
2chr326 and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying
2chr327 be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him
2chr328 with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah
2chr329 after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that were at jerusalem saying
2chr3210 thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem
2chr3211 doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria
2chr3212 hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it
2chr3213 know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand
2chr3214 who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand
2chr3215 now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand
2chr3216 and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah
2chr3217 he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand
2chr3218 then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the city
2chr3219 and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man
2chr3220 and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz prayed and cried to heaven
2chr3221 and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword
2chr3222 thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guided them on every side
2chr3223 and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presents to hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth
2chr3224 in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign
2chr3225 but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem
2chr3226 notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah
2chr3227 and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant jewels
2chr3228 storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks
2chr3229 moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him substance very much
2chr3230 this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david and hezekiah prospered in all his works
2chr3231 howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart
2chr3232 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr3233 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh his son reigned in his stead
2chr331 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem
2chr332 but did that which was evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel
2chr333 for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them
2chr334 also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever
2chr335 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord
2chr336 and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
2chr337 and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever
2chr338 neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that i have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses
2chr339 so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel
2chr3310 and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken
2chr3311 wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon
2chr3312 and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers
2chr3313 and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he was god
2chr3314 now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah
2chr3315 and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city
2chr3316 and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel
2chr3317 nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the lord their god only
2chr3318 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel
2chr3319 his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold they are written among the sayings of the seers
2chr3320 so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead
2chr3321 amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in jerusalem
2chr3322 but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made and served them
2chr3323 and humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but amon trespassed more and more
2chr3324 and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house
2chr3325 but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead
2chr341 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years
2chr342 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left
2chr343 for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten images
2chr344 and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them
2chr345 and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed judah and jerusalem
2chr346 and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about
2chr347 and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem
2chr348 now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god
2chr349 and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they returned to jerusalem
2chr3410 and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house
2chr3411 even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed
2chr3412 and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments of musick
2chr3413 also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters
2chr3414 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses
2chr3415 and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan
2chr3416 and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants they do it
2chr3417 and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmen
2chr3418 then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it before the king
2chr3419 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes
2chr3420 and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a servant of the king's saying
2chr3421 go enquire of the lord for me and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord to do after all that is written in this book
2chr3422 and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they spake to her to that effect
2chr3423 and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell ye the man that sent you to me
2chr3424 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah
2chr3425 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched
2chr3426 and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of the lord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israel concerning the words which thou hast heard
2chr3427 because thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord
2chr3428 behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the king word again
2chr3429 then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem
2chr3430 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord
2chr3431 and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book
2chr3432 and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers
2chr3433 and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that were present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god and all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of their fathers
2chr351 moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
2chr352 and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord
2chr353 and said unto the levites that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the lord your god and his people israel
2chr354 and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son
2chr355 and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the division of the families of the levites
2chr356 so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses
2chr357 and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the king's substance
2chr358 and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of the house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen
2chr359 conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto the levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen
2chr3510 so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites in their courses according to the king's commandment
2chr3511 and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands and the levites flayed them
2chr3512 and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did they with the oxen
2chr3513 and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people
2chr3514 and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron
2chr3515 and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the king's seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them
2chr3516 so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah
2chr3517 and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days
2chr3518 and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem
2chr3519 in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept
2chr3520 after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah went out against him
2chr3521 but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not
2chr3522 nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo
2chr3523 and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded
2chr3524 his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah
2chr3525 and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations
2chr3526 now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according to that which was written in the law of the lord
2chr3527 and his deeds first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah
2chr361 then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his father's stead in jerusalem
2chr362 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem
2chr363 and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
2chr364 and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho took jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt
2chr365 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god
2chr366 against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon
2chr367 nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon
2chr368 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead
2chr369 jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord
2chr3610 and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem
2chr3611 zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in jerusalem
2chr3612 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord
2chr3613 and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel
2chr3614 moreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem
2chr3615 and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place
2chr3616 but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was no remedy
2chr3617 therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his hand
2chr3618 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon
2chr3619 and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof
2chr3620 and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia
2chr3621 to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years
2chr3622 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying
2chr3623 thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go up
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying
thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem which is in judah
who is there among you of all his people his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem
and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of god that is in jerusalem
then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin and the priests and the levites with all them whose spirit god had raised to go up to build the house of the lord which is in jerusalem
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with precious things beside all that was willingly offered
also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the lord which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods
even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and numbered them unto sheshbazzar the prince of judah
and this is the number of them thirty chargers of gold a thousand chargers of silver nine and twenty knives
thirty basons of gold silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten and other vessels a thousand
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred all these did sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those which had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and came again unto jerusalem and judah every one unto his city

the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred fifty and two
and of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the children of koz the children of barzillai which took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore
beside their servants and their maids of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women
their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five
their camels four hundred thirty and five their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty
and some of the chief of the fathers when they came to the house of the lord which is at jerusalem offered freely for the house of god to set it up in his place
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold and five thousand pound of silver and one hundred priests garments
so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the singers and the porters and the nethinims dwelt in their cities and all israel in their cities
and when the seventh month was come and the children of israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem
then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and builded the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god
and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning and evening
they kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom as the duty of every day required
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the lord that were consecrated and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the lord but the foundation of the temple of the lord was not yet laid
they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and meat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of tyre to bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa according to the grant that they had of cyrus king of persia
now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord
then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and his sons the sons of judah together to set forward the workmen in the house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethren the levites
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel
and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever toward israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid
but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel
then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your god as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of esarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither
but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building
and hired counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia
and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem
and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and interpreted in the syrian tongue
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort
then wrote rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites the dehavites and the elamites
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities of samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a time
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto artaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river and at such a time
be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from thee to us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations
be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings
now because we have maintenance from the king's palace and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour therefore have we sent and certified the king
that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed
we certify the king that if this city be builded again and the walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river
then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such a time
the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me
and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein
there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and custom was paid unto them
give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given from me
take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings
now when the copy of king artaxerxes letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia
then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel even unto them
then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them
at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall
then said we unto them after this manner what are the names of the men that make this building
but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter
the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites which were on this side the river sent unto darius the king
they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all peace
be it known unto the king that we went into the province of judea to the house of the great god which is builded with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their hands
then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded you to build this house and to make up these walls
we asked their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them
and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into babylon
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king cyrus made a decree to build this house of god
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought them into the temple of babylon those did cyrus the king take out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor
and said unto him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in jerusalem and let the house of god be builded in his place
then came the same sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the house of god which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet it is not finished
now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search made in the king's treasure house which is there at babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter
then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in babylon
and there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the province of the medes a roll and therein was a record thus written
in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem let the house be builded the place where they offered sacrifices and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubits
with three rows of great stones and a row of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the king's house
and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at jerusalem and brought unto babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at jerusalem every one to his place and place them in the house of god
now therefore tatnai governor beyond the river shetharboznai and your companions the apharsachites which are beyond the river be ye far from thence
let the work of this house of god alone let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in his place
moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these jews for the building of this house of god that of the king's goods even of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expenses be given unto these men that they be not hindered
and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons
also i have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this
and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of god which is at jerusalem i darius have made a decree let it be done with speed
then tatnai governor on this side the river shetharboznai and their companions according to that which darius the king had sent so they did speedily
and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo and they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the god of israel and according to the commandment of cyrus and darius and artaxerxes king of persia
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king
and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this house of god with joy
and offered at the dedication of this house of god an hundred bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for all israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes of israel
and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is written in the book of moses
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month
for the priests and the levites were purified together all of them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves
and the children of israel which were come again out of captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the lord god of israel did eat
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for the lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god the god of israel
now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah
the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub
the son of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth
the son of zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki
the son of abishua the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief priest
this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of moses which the lord god of israel had given and the king granted him all his request according to the hand of the lord his god upon him
and there went up some of the children of israel and of the priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the nethinims unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the king
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem according to the good hand of his god upon him
for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord and to do it and to teach in israel statutes and judgments
now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave unto ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the lord and of his statutes to israel
artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest a scribe of the law of the god of heaven perfect peace and at such a time
i make a decree that all they of the people of israel and of his priests and levites in my realm which are minded of their own freewill to go up to jerusalem go with thee
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven counsellors to enquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to the law of thy god which is in thine hand
and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in jerusalem
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of your god
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god those deliver thou before the god of jerusalem
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the king's treasure house
and i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of you it be done speedily
unto an hundred talents of silver and to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much
whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be diligently done for the house of the god of heaven for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons
also we certify you that touching any of the priests and levites singers porters nethinims or ministers of this house of god it shall not be lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon them
and thou ezra after the wisdom of thy god that is in thine hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy god and teach ye them that know them not
and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment
blessed be the lord god of our fathers which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart to beautify the house of the lord which is in jerusalem
and hath extended mercy unto me before the king and his counsellors and before all the king's mighty princes and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me and i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me
these are now the chief of their fathers and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon in the reign of artaxerxes the king
of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar daniel of the sons of david hattush
of the sons of shechaniah of the sons of pharosh zechariah and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty
of the sons of pahathmoab elihoenai the son of zerahiah and with him two hundred males
of the sons of shechaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three hundred males
of the sons also of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him fifty males
and of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with him seventy males
and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and with him fourscore males
of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males
and of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him an hundred and threescore males
and of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with him twenty and eight males
and of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with him an hundred and ten males
and of the last sons of adonikam whose names are these eliphelet jeiel and shemaiah and with them threescore males
of the sons also of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them seventy males
and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava and there abode we in tents three days and i viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of levi
then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for elnathan men of understanding
and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo and to his brethren the nethinims at the place casiphia that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our god
and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen
and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brethren and their sons twenty
also of the nethinims whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name
then i proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance
for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him
so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was intreated of us
then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them
and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his lords and all israel there present had offered
i even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents
also twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine copper precious as gold
and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the lord god of your fathers
watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel at jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord
so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house of our god
then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way
and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days
now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui levites
by number and by weight of every one and all the weight was written at that time
also the children of those that had been carried away which were come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god of israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burnt offering unto the lord
and they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they furthered the people and the house of god
now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass
and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice
and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the lord my god
and said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens
since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day
and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage
for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem
and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments
which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness
now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever
and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as this
should we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping
o lord god of israel thou art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this
now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very sore
and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing
now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and let it be done according to the law
arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it
then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they sware
then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem
and that whosoever would not come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away
then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the great rain
and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass of israel
now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the strange wives
then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice as thou hast said so must we do
but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing
let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them
and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priest with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass
and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah
and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah
and of the sons of pashur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethaneel jozabad and elasah
also of the levites jozabad and shimei and kelaiah the same is kelita pethahiah judah and eliezer
of the singers also eliashib and of the porters shallum and telem and uri
moreover of israel of the sons of parosh ramiah and jeziah and malchiah and miamin and eleazar and malchijah and benaiah
and of the sons of elam mattaniah zechariah and jehiel and abdi and jeremoth and eliah
and of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah and jeremoth and zabad and aziza
of the sons also of bebai jehohanan hananiah zabbai and athlai
and of the sons of bani meshullam malluch and adaiah jashub and sheal and ramoth

of the sons of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina jadau and joel benaiah
all these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children
the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah and it came to pass in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace
that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem
and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire
and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven
and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments
let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my father's house have sinned
we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandedst thy servant moses
remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations
but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there
now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand
o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the king's cupbearer
and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine and gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in his presence
wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then i was very sore afraid
and said unto the king let the king live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire
then the king said unto me for what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven
and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build it
and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time
moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till i come into judah
and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the king's forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me
then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me
when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel
so i came to jerusalem and was there three days
and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon
and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire
then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass
then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned
and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work
then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in how jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more a reproach
then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work
but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye rebel against the king
then answered i them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem
then eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and they builded the sheep gate they sanctified it and set up the doors of it even unto the tower of meah they sanctified it unto the tower of hananeel
and next unto him builded the men of jericho and next to them builded zaccur the son of imri

after him repaired their brethren bavai the son of henadad the ruler of the half part of keilah
and next to him repaired ezer the son of jeshua the ruler of mizpah another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall
after him baruch the son of zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of eliashib the high priest

and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants
but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews
and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned
now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall
hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity
and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders
so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work
but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wroth
and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it
nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them
and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall
and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease
and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you
therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows
and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses
and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returned all of us to the wall every one unto his work
and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulers were behind all the house of judah
they which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens with those that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon
for the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and so builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me
and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither unto us our god shall fight for us
so we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared
likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us and labour on the day
so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that every one put them off for washing
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the jews
for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live
some also there were that said we have mortgaged our lands vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth
there were also that said we have borrowed money for the king's tribute and that upon our lands and vineyards
yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and vineyards
and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words
then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother and i set a great assembly against them
and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held they their peace and found nothing to answer
also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies
i likewise and my brethren and my servants might exact of them money and corn i pray you let us leave off this usury
restore i pray you to them even this day their lands their vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of them
then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do as thou sayest then i called the priests and took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise
also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man from his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation said amen and praised the lord and the people did according to this promise
moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people but so did not i because of the fear of god
yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us
now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people
think upon me my god for good according to all that i have done for this people
now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded the wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time i had not set up the doors upon the gates
that sanballat and geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief
and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave it and come down to you
yet they sent unto me four times after this sort and i answered them after the same manner
then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand
wherein was written it is reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king according to these words
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and let us take counsel together
then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done now therefore o god strengthen my hands
afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meet together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay thee
and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that being as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will not go in
and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had hired him
therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me
my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul in fifty and two days
and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god
moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them
for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah
also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear
now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed
that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared god above many
and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against his house
now the city was large and great but the people were few therein and the houses were not builded
and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy and i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first and found written therein
these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and came again to jerusalem and to judah every one unto his city

the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore
beside their manservants and their maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women
their horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five
their camels four hundred thirty and five six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work the tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold fifty basons five hundred and thirty priests garments
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and seven priests garments
so the priests and the levites and the porters and the singers and some of the people and the nethinims and all israel dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children of israel were in their cities
and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel
and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month
and he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law
and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and anaiah and urijah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchiah and hashum and hashbadana zechariah and meshullam
and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up
and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground
also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai hodijah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place
so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading
and nehemiah which is the tirshatha and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law
then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength
so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be ye grieved
and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the scribe even to understand the words of the law
and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month
and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is written
so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the water gate and in the street of the gate of ephraim
and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so and there was very great gladness
also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the manner
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting and with sackclothes and earth upon them
and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers
and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the lord their god one fourth part of the day and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the lord their god
then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani and cried with a loud voice unto the lord their god
then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabniah sherebiah hodijah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless the lord your god for ever and ever and blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise
thou even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee
thou art the lord the god who didst choose abram and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees and gavest him the name of abraham
and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the canaanites the hittites the amorites and the perizzites and the jebusites and the girgashites to give it i say to his seed and hast performed thy words for thou art righteous
and didst see the affliction of our fathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea
and shewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants and on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is this day
and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go
thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them from heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws good statutes and commandments
and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the hand of moses thy servant
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them
but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments
and refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them not
yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great provocations
yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to shew them light and the way wherein they should go
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst
yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide them into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers that they should go in to possess it
so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they would
and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness
nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations
therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their enemies
but after they had rest they did evil again before thee therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies
and testifiedst against them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear
yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands
nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god
now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible god who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto this day
howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou hast done right but we have done wickedly
neither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them
for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works
behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof behold we are servants in it
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distress
and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes levites and priests seal unto it

and the rest of the people the priests the levites the porters the singers the nethinims and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of god their wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge and having understanding
they clave to their brethren their nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in god's law which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe and do all the commandments of the lord our lord and his judgments and his statutes
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land nor take their daughters for our sons

and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the treasure house
for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring the offering of the corn of the new wine and the oil unto the chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that minister and the porters and the singers and we will not forsake the house of our god
and the rulers of the people dwelt at jerusalem the rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the holy city and nine parts to dwell in other cities

the levites in the days of eliashib joiada and johanan and jaddua were recorded chief of the fathers also the priests to the reign of darius the persian
the sons of levi the chief of the fathers were written in the book of the chronicles even until the days of johanan the son of eliashib
and the chief of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua the son of kadmiel with their brethren over against them to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of god ward over against ward
mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates
these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the governor and of ezra the priest the scribe
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and with singing with cymbals psalteries and with harps
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both out of the plain country round about jerusalem and from the villages of netophathi
also from the house of gilgal and out of the fields of geba and azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages round about jerusalem
and the priests and the levites purified themselves and purified the people and the gates and the wall
then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate
and after them went hoshaiah and half of the princes of judah
and azariah ezra and meshullam
judah and benjamin and shemaiah and jeremiah
and certain of the priests sons with trumpets namely zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of mattaniah the son of michaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph
and his brethren shemaiah and azarael milalai gilalai maai nethaneel and judah hanani with the musical instruments of david the man of god and ezra the scribe before them
and at the fountain gate which was over against them they went up by the stairs of the city of david at the going up of the wall above the house of david even unto the water gate eastward
and the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them and i after them and the half of the people upon the wall from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall
and from above the gate of ephraim and above the old gate and above the fish gate and the tower of hananeel and the tower of meah even unto the sheep gate and they stood still in the prison gate
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of god and i and the half of the rulers with me
and the priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin michaiah elioenai zechariah and hananiah with trumpets
and maaseiah and shemaiah and eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer and the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer
also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for god had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off
and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the priests and for the levites that waited
and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their god and the ward of the purification according to the commandment of david and of solomon his son
for in the days of david and asaph of old there were chief of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god
and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people and therein was found written that the ammonite and the moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever
because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing
now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude
and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah
and he had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priests
but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king and after certain days obtained i leave of the king
and i came to jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god
and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the chamber
then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meat offering and the frankincense
and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them for the levites and the singers that did the work were fled every one to his field
then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their place
then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries
and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethren
remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices thereof
in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals
there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah and in jerusalem
then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day
did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath
and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and some of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day
so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without jerusalem once or twice
then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath
and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day remember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy
in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod of ammon and of moab
and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people
and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god saying ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves
did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin
shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to transgress against our god in marrying strange wives
and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me
remember them o my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites
thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the levites every one in his business
and for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits remember me o my god for good
now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces
that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace
in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days
and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace
where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king
and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus
on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king
to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on
but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him
then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment
and the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw the king's face and which sat the first in the kingdom
what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains
and memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not
likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath
if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she
and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honour both to great and small
and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan
for he sent letters into all the king's provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people
after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her
then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king
and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hege the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them
and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so
now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite
who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away
and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter
so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the king's house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women
and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the king's house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women
esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how esther did and what should become of her
now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the women
then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house
in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the king's chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name
now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign
and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai sat in the king's gate
esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him
in those days while mordecai sat in the king's gate two of the king's chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus
and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecai's name
and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king
after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him
and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence
then the king's servants which were in the king's gate said unto mordecai why transgressest thou the king's commandment
now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai's matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath
and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecai
in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is the month adar
and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them
if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king's treasuries
and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy
and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee
then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors that were over every province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and sealed with the king's ring
and the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the spoil of them for a prey
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that day
the posts went out being hastened by the king's commandment and the decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and haman sat down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed
when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry
and came even before the king's gate for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth
and in every province whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes
so esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it not
then called esther for hatach one of the king's chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to mordecai to know what it was and why it was
so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the king's gate
and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the jews to destroy them
also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people
and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai
again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto mordecai
all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days
and they told to mordecai esther's words
then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this
then esther bade them return mordecai this answer
go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish
so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him
now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house
and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre
then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom
and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him
then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared
and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed
then answered esther and said my petition and my request is
if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said
then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the king's gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai
nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife
and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king
haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king
yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king's gate
then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and he caused the gallows to be made
on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king
and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the king's chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus
and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this then said the king's servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him
and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into the outward court of the king's house to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him
and the king's servants said unto him behold haman standeth in the court and the king said let him come in
so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself
and haman answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honour
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head
and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour
then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the king's gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken
then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour
and mordecai came again to the king's gate but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered
and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him
and while they were yet talking with him came the king's chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen
and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom
then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request
for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage
then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so
and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king
then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of the king's mouth they covered haman's face
and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman then the king said hang him thereon
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the king's wrath pacified
on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her
and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman
and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews
then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king
and said if it please the king and if i have found favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's provinces
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred
then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews
write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse
then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language
and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedaries
wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey
upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment and the decree was given at shushan the palace
and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad
the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour
and in every province and in every city whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them
now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them
the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all people
and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear of mordecai fell upon them
for mordecai was great in the king's house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater
thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men
and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha
and poratha and adalia and aridatha
and parmashta and arisai and aridai and vajezatha
the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king
and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done
then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree and let haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows
and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged haman's ten sons
for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand
but the other jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the prey
on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and made it a day of feasting and gladness
but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness
therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another
and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far
to stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly
as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai had written unto them
because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them
but when esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows
wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them
the jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seed
then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim
and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace and truth
to confirm these days of purim in their times appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and their cry
and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it was written in the book
and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea
and all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advanced him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia
for mordecai the jew was next unto king ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to all his seed
there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters
his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east
and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them
and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually
now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them
and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil
then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought
hast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land
but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face
and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
and there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them
and the sabeans fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped
and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord
in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly
again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord
and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause
and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life
but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face
and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life
so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he sat down among the ashes
then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine integrity curse god and die
but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips
now when job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great
after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day
and job spake and said
let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it was said there is a man child conceived
let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it
as for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not be joined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months
lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein
let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up their mourning
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day
because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow from mine eyes
why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghost when i came out of the belly
why did the knees prevent me or why the breasts that i should suck
for now should i have lain still and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest
with kings and counsellors of the earth which built desolate places for themselves
or with princes that had gold who filled their houses with silver
or as an hidden untimely birth i had not been as infants which never saw light
there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest
there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor
the small and great are there and the servant is free from his master
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul
which long for death but it cometh not and dig for it more than for hid treasures
which rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave
why is light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in
for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are poured out like the waters
for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me
i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said
if we assay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking
behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast strengthened the weak hands
thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees
but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee and thou art troubled
is not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways
remember i pray thee who ever perished being innocent or where were the righteous cut off
even as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same
by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed
the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad
now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a little thereof
in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on men
fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake
then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up
it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice saying
shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be more pure than his maker
behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with folly
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the moth
they are destroyed from morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it
doth not their excellency which is in them go away they die even without wisdom
call now if there be any that will answer thee and to which of the saints wilt thou turn
for wrath killeth the foolish man and envy slayeth the silly one
i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his habitation
his children are far from safety and they are crushed in the gate neither is there any to deliver them
whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the thorns and the robber swalloweth up their substance
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth trouble spring out of the ground
yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward
i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause
which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without number
who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon the fields
to set up on high those that be low that those which mourn may be exalted to safety
he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong
they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noonday as in the night
but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from the hand of the mighty
so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth
behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty
for he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole
he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee
in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season
lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy good
but job answered and said
oh that my grief were throughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up
for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over his fodder
can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the white of an egg
the things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat
oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the thing that i long for
even that it would please god to destroy me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off
then should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one
what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine end that i should prolong my life
is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brass
is not my help in me and is wisdom driven quite from me
to him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream of brooks they pass away
which are blackish by reason of the ice and wherein the snow is hid
what time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place
the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and perish
the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them
they were confounded because they had hoped they came thither and were ashamed
for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid
did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of your substance
or deliver me from the enemy's hand or redeem me from the hand of the mighty
teach me and i will hold my tongue and cause me to understand wherein i have erred
how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove
do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is desperate which are as wind
yea ye overwhelm the fatherless and ye dig a pit for your friend
now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto you if i lie
return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my righteousness is in it
is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse things
is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not his days also like the days of an hireling
as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work
so am i made to possess months of vanity and wearisome nights are appointed to me
when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is broken and become loathsome
my days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and are spent without hope
o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good
the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes are upon me and i am not
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more
he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more
therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul
am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint
then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions
so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life
i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity
what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him
and that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment
how long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my spittle
i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away mine iniquity for now shall i sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be
then answered bildad the shuhite and said
how long wilt thou speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind
doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty pervert justice
if thy children have sinned against him and he have cast them away for their transgression
if thou wouldest seek unto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty
if thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous
though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increase
for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers
for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow
shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heart
can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without water
whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herb
so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrite's hope shall perish
whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spider's web
he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure
he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his garden
his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of stones
if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying i have not seen thee
behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others grow
behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he help the evil doers
till he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought
then job answered and said
i know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with god
if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand
he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered
which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger
which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof tremble
which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the stars
which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea
which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers of the south
which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without number
lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i perceive him not
behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou
if god will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under him
how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to reason with him
whom though i were righteous yet would i not answer but i would make supplication to my judge
if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice
for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds without cause
he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness
if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who shall set me a time to plead
if i justify myself mine own mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me perverse
though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would despise my life
this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked
if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he
now my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good
they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that hasteth to the prey
if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself
i am afraid of all my sorrows i know that thou wilt not hold me innocent
if i be wicked why then labour i in vain
if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean
yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me
for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment
neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both
let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me
then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with me
my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint upon myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul
i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked
hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man seeth
are thy days as the days of man are thy years as man's days
that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin
thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand
thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dost destroy me
remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again
hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews
thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that this is with thee
if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity
if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will i not lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine affliction
for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lion and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me
thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine indignation upon me changes and war are against me
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me
i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave
are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little
before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death
a land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darkness
then answered zophar the naamathite and said
should not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justified
should thy lies make men hold their peace and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed
for thou hast said my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes
but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth
canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection
it is as high as heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know
the measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea
if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder him
for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also will he not then consider it
for vain man would be wise though man be born like a wild ass's colt
if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward him
if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles
for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear
because thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away
and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be as the morning
and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety
also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto thee
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost
and job answered and said
no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with you
but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these
i am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him the just upright man is laughed to scorn
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease
the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly
but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee
or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind
doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat
with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding
with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and understanding
behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no opening
behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth
with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his
he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judges fools
he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a girdle
he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty
he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understanding of the aged
he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of the mighty
he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death
he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the nations and straiteneth them again
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way
they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man
lo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard and understood it
what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior unto you
surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with god
but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value
o that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdom
hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips
will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him
will ye accept his person will ye contend for god
is it good that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another do ye so mock him
he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept persons
shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall upon you
your remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies to bodies of clay
hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come on me what will
wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in mine hand
though he slay me yet will i trust in him but i will maintain mine own ways before him
he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before him
hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ears
behold now i have ordered my cause i know that i shall be justified
who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tongue i shall give up the ghost
only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself from thee
withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me afraid
then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer thou me
how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my transgression and my sin
wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy
wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble
for thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowly unto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet
and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth eaten
man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble
he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not
and dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one
seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass
turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling his day
for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease
though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground
yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant
but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost and where is he
as the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up
so man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep
o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me
if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come
thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands
for now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my sin
my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up mine iniquity
and surely the mountain falling cometh to nought and the rock is removed out of his place
the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of man
thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sendest him away
his sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them
but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mourn
then answered eliphaz the temanite and said
should a wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind
should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he can do no good
yea thou castest off fear and restrainest prayer before god
for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty
thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lips testify against thee
art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before the hills
hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself
what knowest thou that we know not what understandest thou which is not in us
with us are both the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father
are the consolations of god small with thee is there any secret thing with thee
why doth thine heart carry thee away and what do thy eyes wink at
that thou turnest thy spirit against god and lettest such words go out of thy mouth
what is man that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous
behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the heavens are not clean in his sight
how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh iniquity like water
i will shew thee hear me and that which i have seen i will declare
which wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it
unto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among them
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor
a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is waited for of the sword
he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail against him as a king ready to the battle
for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth himself against the almighty
he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of his bucklers
because he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flanks
and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps
he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth
he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away
let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompence
it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall not be green
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olive
for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery
they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly prepareth deceit
then job answered and said
i have heard many such things miserable comforters are ye all
shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest
i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my soul's stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you
but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief
though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbear what am i eased
but now he hath made me weary thou hast made desolate all my company
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face
he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me
they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together against me
god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked
i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark
his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground
he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dust
my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death
not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is pure
o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place
also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on high
my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god
o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for his neighbour
when a few years are come then i shall go the way whence i shall not return
my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for me
are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation
lay down now put me in a surety with thee who is he that will strike hands with me
for thou hast hid their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them
he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his children shall fail
he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i was as a tabret
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadow
upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite
the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger
but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot find one wise man among you
my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart
they change the night into day the light is short because of darkness
if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in the darkness
i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou art my mother and my sister
and where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it
they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest together is in the dust
then answered bildad the shuhite and said
how long will it be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak
wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your sight
he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place
yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with him
the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him down
for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a snare
the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against him
the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in the way
terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feet
his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side
it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terrors
it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation
his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off
his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street
he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world
he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings
they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they that went before were affrighted
surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the place of him that knoweth not god
then job answered and said
how long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words
these ten times have ye reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me
and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with myself
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach
know now that god hath overthrown me and hath compassed me with his net
behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud but there is no judgment
he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths
he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head
he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope hath he removed like a tree
he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies
his troops come together and raise up their way against me and encamp round about my tabernacle
he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me
my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me
they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight
i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated him with my mouth
my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for the children's sake of mine own body
yea young children despised me i arose and they spake against me
all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved are turned against me
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth
have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god hath touched me
why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh
oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book
that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever
for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god
whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me
but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of the matter is found in me
be ye afraid of the sword for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgment
then answered zophar the naamathite and said
therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer and for this i make haste
i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer
knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth
that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment
though his excellency mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds
yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say where is he
he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold him
his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goods
his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue
though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouth
yet his meat in his bowels is turned it is the gall of asps within him
he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again god shall cast them out of his belly
he shall suck the poison of asps the viper's tongue shall slay him
he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and butter
that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice therein
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that which he desired
there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man look for his goods
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand of the wicked shall come upon him
when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating
he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through
it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle
the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him
the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath
this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage appointed unto him by god
but job answered and said
hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolations
suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock on
as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled
mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth
even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my flesh
wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in power
their seed is established in their sight with them and their offspring before their eyes
their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them
their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calf
they send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance
they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ
they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the grave
therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways
what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him
lo their good is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me
how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger
they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away
god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him and he shall know it
his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midst
shall any teach god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high
one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet
his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with marrow
and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure
they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover them
behold i know your thoughts and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me
for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are the dwelling places of the wicked
have ye not asked them that go by the way and do ye not know their tokens
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath
who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath done
yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him
how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said
can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself
is it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect
will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter with thee into judgment
is not thy wickedness great and thine iniquities infinite
for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry
but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable man dwelt in it
thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been broken
therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth thee
or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of waters cover thee
is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they are
and thou sayest how doth god know can he judge through the dark cloud
thick clouds are a covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heaven
hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden
which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown with a flood
which said unto god depart from us and what can the almighty do for them
yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me
the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn
whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them the fire consumeth
acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee
receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thine heart
if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as the stones of the brooks
yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have plenty of silver
for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vows
thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee and the light shall shine upon thy ways
when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lifting up and he shall save the humble person
he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands
then job answered and said
even to day is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning
oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to his seat
i would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments
i would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me
will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me
there the righteous might dispute with him so should i be delivered for ever from my judge
behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i cannot perceive him
on the left hand where he doth work but i cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot see him
but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold
my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined
neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food
but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth
for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him
therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i am afraid of him
for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me
because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face
why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that know him not see his days
some remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed thereof
they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widow's ox for a pledge
they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide themselves together
behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children
they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the vintage of the wicked
they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no covering in the cold
they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelter
they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor
they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungry
which make oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst
men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them
they are of those that rebel against the light they know not the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy and in the night is as a thief
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face
in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the light
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death
he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards
drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave those which have sinned
the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a tree
he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widow
he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no man is sure of life
though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet his eyes are upon their ways
they are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn
and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my speech nothing worth
then answered bildad the shuhite and said
dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places
is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his light arise
how then can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman
behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight
how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm
but job answered and said
how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is
to whom hast thou uttered words and whose spirit came from thee
dead things are formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof
hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering
he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under them
he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon it
he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end
the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof
he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud
by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the crooked serpent
lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand
moreover job continued his parable and said
as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul
all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils
my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit
god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will not remove mine integrity from me
my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live
let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous
for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when god taketh away his soul
will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him
will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god
i will teach you by the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal
behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus altogether vain
this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the almighty
if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread
those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his widows shall not weep
though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay
he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver
he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper maketh
the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is not
terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away in the night
the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a storm hurleth him out of his place
for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee out of his hand
men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his place
surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine it
iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stone
he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection the stones of darkness and the shadow of death
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men
as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned up as it were fire
the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold
there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vulture's eye hath not seen
the lion's whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it
he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountains by the roots
he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thing
he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light
but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understanding
man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living
the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not with me
it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof
it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold
no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price of wisdom is above rubies
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold
whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of understanding
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the air
destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ears
god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof
for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven
to make the weight for the winds and he weigheth the waters by measure
when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder
then did he see it and declare it he prepared it yea and searched it out
and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding
moreover job continued his parable and said
oh that i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me
when his candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through darkness
as i was in the days of my youth when the secret of god was upon my tabernacle
when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me
when i washed my steps with butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil
when i went out to the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street
the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and stood up
the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their mouth
the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth
when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me
because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widow's heart to sing for joy
i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diadem
i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame
i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out
and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth
then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my days as the sand
my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon my branch
my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand
unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counsel
after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon them
and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain
if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my countenance they cast not down
i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comforteth the mourners
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock
yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom old age was perished
for want and famine they were solitary fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste
who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their meat
they were driven forth from among men they cried after them as after a thief
to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in caves of the earth and in the rocks
among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered together
they were children of fools yea children of base men they were viler than the earth
and now am i their song yea i am their byword
they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my face
because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also let loose the bridle before me
upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction
they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no helper
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me
terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and my welfare passeth away as a cloud
and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction have taken hold upon me
my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews take no rest
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat
he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and ashes
i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou regardest me not
thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me
thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substance
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living
howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though they cry in his destruction
did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor
when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness
my bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction prevented me
i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in the congregation
i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls
my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat
my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of them that weep
i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a maid
for what portion of god is there from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high
is not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity
doth not he see my ways and count all my steps
if i have walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit
let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity
if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands
then let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid wait at my neighbour's door
then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her
for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges
for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increase
if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me
what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him
did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb
if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail
or have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father and i have guided her from my mother's womb
if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering
if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate
then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone
for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason of his highness i could not endure
if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou art my confidence
if i rejoiced because my wealth was great and because mine hand had gotten much
if i beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightness
and my heart hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand
this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should have denied the god that is above
if i rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him
neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul
if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his flesh we cannot be satisfied
the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller
if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom
did i fear a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of the door
oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book
surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to me
i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would i go near unto him
if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complain
if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life
let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley the words of job are ended
so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes
then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job
now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elder than he
when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindled
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew you mine opinion
i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom
but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding
great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgment
therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion
behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons whilst ye searched out what to say
yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of you that convinced job or that answered his words
lest ye should say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man
now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches
they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking
when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and answered no more
i said i will answer also my part i also will shew mine opinion
for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me
behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles
i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer
let me not i pray you accept any man's person neither let me give flattering titles unto man
for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away
wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words
behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouth
my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly
the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty hath given me life
if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand up
behold i am according to thy wish in god's stead i also am formed out of the clay
behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and i have heard the voice of thy words saying
i am clean without transgression i am innocent neither is there iniquity in me
behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his enemy
he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my paths
behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that god is greater than man
why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters
for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not
in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed
then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction
that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man
he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain
so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat
his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out
yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyers
if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightness
then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom
his flesh shall be fresher than a child's he shall return to the days of his youth
he shall pray unto god and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness
he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light
lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man
to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living
mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will speak
if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify thee
if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee wisdom
furthermore elihu answered and said
hear my words o ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge
for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat
let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is good
for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my judgment
should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without transgression
what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water
which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with wicked men
for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god
therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity
for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways
yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert judgment
who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole world
if he set his heart upon man if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath
all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust
if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words
shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most just
is it fit to say to a king thou art wicked and to princes ye are ungodly
how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his hands
in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without hand
for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goings
there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves
for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god
he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their stead
therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyed
he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others
because they turned back from him and would not consider any of his ways
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted
when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a nation or against a man only
that the hypocrite reign not lest the people be ensnared
surely it is meet to be said unto god i have borne chastisement i will not offend any more
that which i see not teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more
should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore speak what thou knowest
let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me
job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without wisdom
my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplieth his words against god
elihu spake moreover and said
thinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst my righteousness is more than god's
for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin
i will answer thee and thy companions with thee
look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than thou
if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him
if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand
thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy righteousness may profit the son of man
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty
but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the night
who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven
there they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men
surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty regard it
although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou in him
but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet he knoweth it not in great extremity
therefore doth job open his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge
elihu also proceeded and said
suffer me a little and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god's behalf
i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker
for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee
behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength and wisdom
he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poor
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they are exalted
and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of affliction
then he sheweth them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded
he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquity
if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures
but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge
but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them
they die in youth and their life is among the unclean
he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears in oppression
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold on thee
because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee
will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of strength
desire not the night when people are cut off in their place
take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction
behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him
who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought iniquity
remember that thou magnify his work which men behold
every man may see it man may behold it afar off
behold god is great and we know him not neither can the number of his years be searched out
for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof
which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly
also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tabernacle
behold he spreadeth his light upon it and covereth the bottom of the sea
for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance
with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt
the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also concerning the vapour
at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place
hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouth
he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the ends of the earth
after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard
god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend
for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strength
he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his work
then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places
out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north
by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the waters is straitened
also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his bright cloud
and it is turned round about by his counsels that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth
he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercy
hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god
dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine
dost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge
how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind
hast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong and as a molten looking glass
teach us what we shall say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness
shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely he shall be swallowed up
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but the wind passeth and cleanseth them
fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terrible majesty
touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflict
men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heart
then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said
who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge
gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding
who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it
whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof
when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy
or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb
when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it
and brake up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors
and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed
hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caused the dayspring to know his place
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it
it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as a garment
and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm shall be broken
hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the search of the depth
have the gates of death been opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death
hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou knowest it all
where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness where is the place thereof
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof
knowest thou it because thou wast then born or because the number of thy days is great
hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail
which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war
by what way is the light parted which scattereth the east wind upon the earth
who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of thunder
to cause it to rain on the earth where no man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man
to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth
hath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dew
out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it
the waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen
canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion
canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons
knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth
canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee
canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart
who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the bottles of heaven
when the dust groweth into hardness and the clods cleave fast together
wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions
when they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait
who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve
canst thou number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they bring forth
they bow themselves they bring forth their young ones they cast out their sorrows
their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they go forth and return not unto them
who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass
whose house i have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellings
he scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the crying of the driver
the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after every green thing
will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib
canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will he harrow the valleys after thee
wilt thou trust him because his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to him
wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn
gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks or wings and feathers unto the ostrich
which leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dust
and forgetteth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them
she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labour is in vain without fear
because god hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding
what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and his rider
hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunder
canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible
he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men
he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he back from the sword
the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shield
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet
he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south
doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place
from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off
her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she
moreover the lord answered job and said
shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it
then job answered the lord and said
behold i am vile what shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth
once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further
then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said
gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me
wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous
hast thou an arm like god or canst thou thunder with a voice like him
deck thyself now with majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty
cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and abase him
look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked in their place
hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret
then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee
behold now behemoth which i made with thee he eateth grass as an ox
lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the navel of his belly
he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are wrapped together
his bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars of iron
he is the chief of the ways of god he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him
surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts of the field play
he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and fens
the shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the brook compass him about
behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into his mouth
he taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares
canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down
canst thou put an hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn
will he make many supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee
will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant for ever
wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens
shall the companions make a banquet of him shall they part him among the merchants
canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears
lay thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more
behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him
none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me
who hath prevented me that i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine
i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely proportion
who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him with his double bridle
who can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round about
his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal
one is so near to another that no air can come between them
they are joined one to another they stick together that they cannot be sundered
by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning
out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out
out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or caldron
his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth
in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy before him
the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in themselves they cannot be moved
his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstone
when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of breakings they purify themselves
the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon
he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood
the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubble
darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear
sharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment
he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary
upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear
he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children of pride
then job answered the lord and said
i know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee
who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not
hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me
i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee
wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes
and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath
therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them the lord also accepted job
and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before
then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold
so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses
he had also seven sons and three daughters
and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of the second kezia and the name of the third kerenhappuch
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren
after this lived job an hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations
so job died being old and full of days
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish
why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing
the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying
let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure
yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion
i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel
be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earth
serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling
kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him
lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me
many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in god selah
but thou o lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine head
i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill selah
i laid me down and slept i awaked for the lord sustained me
i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about
arise o lord save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly
salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy people selah
hear me when i call o god of my righteousness thou hast enlarged me when i was in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayer
o ye sons of men how long will ye turn my glory into shame how long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing selah
but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself the lord will hear when i call unto him
stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still selah
offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the lord
there be many that say who will shew us any good lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us
thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased
i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only makest me dwell in safety
give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation
hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto thee will i pray
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up
for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness neither shall evil dwell with thee
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity
thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man
but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple
lead me o lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way straight before my face
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongue
destroy thou them o god let them fall by their own counsels cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against thee
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee
for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield
o lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure
have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak o lord heal me for my bones are vexed
my soul is also sore vexed but thou o lord how long
return o lord deliver my soul oh save me for thy mercies sake
for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks
i am weary with my groaning all the night make i my bed to swim i water my couch with my tears
mine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine enemies
depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping
the lord hath heard my supplication the lord will receive my prayer
let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenly
o lord my god in thee do i put my trust save me from all them that persecute me and deliver me
lest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while there is none to deliver
o lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my hands
if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy
let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust selah
arise o lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about for their sakes therefore return thou on high
the lord shall judge the people judge me o lord according to my righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the just for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins
my defence is of god which saveth the upright in heart
god judgeth the righteous and god is angry with the wicked every day
if he turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it ready
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors
behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood
he made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which he made
his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate
i will praise the lord according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who hast set thy glory above the heavens
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger
when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained
what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour
thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet
all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field
the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth
i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart i will shew forth all thy marvellous works
i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing praise to thy name o thou most high
when mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at thy presence
for thou hast maintained my right and my cause thou satest in the throne judging right
thou hast rebuked the heathen thou hast destroyed the wicked thou hast put out their name for ever and ever
o thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them
but the lord shall endure for ever he hath prepared his throne for judgment
and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness
the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee
sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion declare among the people his doings
when he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them he forgetteth not the cry of the humble
have mercy upon me o lord consider my trouble which i suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death
that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of zion i will rejoice in thy salvation
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken
the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands higgaion selah
the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever
arise o lord let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in thy sight
put them in fear o lord that the nations may know themselves to be but men selah
why standest thou afar off o lord why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined
for the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire and blesseth the covetous whom the lord abhorreth
the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts
his ways are always grievous thy judgments are far above out of his sight as for all his enemies he puffeth at them
he hath said in his heart i shall not be moved for i shall never be in adversity
his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his tongue is mischief and vanity
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages in the secret places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against the poor
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net
he croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by his strong ones
he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his face he will never see it
arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble
wherefore doth the wicked contemn god he hath said in his heart thou wilt not require it
thou hast seen it for thou beholdest mischief and spite to requite it with thy hand the poor committeth himself unto thee thou art the helper of the fatherless
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man seek out his wickedness till thou find none
the lord is king for ever and ever the heathen are perished out of his land
lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble thou wilt prepare their heart thou wilt cause thine ear to hear
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no more oppress
in the lord put i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird to your mountain
for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart
if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do
the lord is in his holy temple the lord's throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men
the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth
upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup
for the righteous lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth behold the upright
help lord for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of men
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak
the lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud things
who have said with our tongue will we prevail our lips are our own who is lord over us
for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him
the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times
thou shalt keep them o lord thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever
the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted
how long wilt thou forget me o lord for ever how long wilt thou hide thy face from me
how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me
consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death
lest mine enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved
but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good
the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god
they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord
there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the righteous
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the lord is his refuge
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when the lord bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad
lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill
he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart
he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not
he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved
preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust
o my soul thou hast said unto the lord thou art my lord my goodness extendeth not to thee
but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god their drink offerings of blood will i not offer nor take up their names into my lips
the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage
i will bless the lord who hath given me counsel my reins also instruct me in the night seasons
i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved
therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore
hear the right o lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips
let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equal
thou hast proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night thou hast tried me and shalt find nothing i am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress
concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept me from the paths of the destroyer
hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not
i have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me o god incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them
keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings
from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who compass me about
they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly
they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth
like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places
arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword
from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes
as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness
i will love thee o lord my strength
the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower
i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies
the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me
in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it
he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet
and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind
he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire
the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire
yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them
then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils
he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters
he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god
for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his statutes from me
i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine iniquity
therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward
for thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down high looks
for thou wilt light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness
for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall
as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him
for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god
it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect
he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places
he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great
thou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip
i have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did i turn again till they were consumed
i have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are fallen under my feet
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me
they cried but there was none to save them even unto the lord but he answered them not
then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom i have not known shall serve me
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers shall submit themselves unto me
the strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close places
the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted
it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me
he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man
therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name
great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore
the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handywork
day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge
there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard
their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple
the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes
the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb
moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward
who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faults
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer
the lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of jacob defend thee
send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of zion
remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice selah
grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy counsel
we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our god we will set up our banners the lord fulfil all thy petitions
now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand
some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god
they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright
save lord let the king hear us when we call
the king shall joy in thy strength o lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice
thou hast given him his heart's desire and hast not withholden the request of his lips selah
for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head
he asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of days for ever and ever
his glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance
for the king trusteth in the lord and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men
for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to perform
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them
be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power
my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring
o my god i cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent
but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel
our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them
they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded
but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people
all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying
he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him
but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mother's breasts
i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mother's belly
be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help
many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset me round
they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion
i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels
my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death
for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet
i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me
they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture
but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee to help me
deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog
save me from the lion's mouth for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns
i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee
ye that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard
my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay my vows before them that fear him
the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord that seek him your heart shall live for ever
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee
for the kingdom is the lord's and he is the governor among the nations
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive his own soul
a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation
they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters
he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever
the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein
for he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods
who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place
he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully
he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation
this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o jacob selah
lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in
who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle
lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in
who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory selah
unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul
o my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine enemies triumph over me
yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgress without cause
shew me thy ways o lord teach me thy paths
lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do i wait all the day
remember o lord thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses for they have been ever of old
remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o lord
good and upright is the lord therefore will he teach sinners in the way
the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way
all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies
for thy name's sake o lord pardon mine iniquity for it is great
what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose
his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth
the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant
mine eyes are ever toward the lord for he shall pluck my feet out of the net
turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and afflicted
the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my distresses
look upon mine affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins
consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with cruel hatred

judge me o lord for i have walked in mine integrity i have trusted also in the lord therefore i shall not slide
examine me o lord and prove me try my reins and my heart
for thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes and i have walked in thy truth
i have not sat with vain persons neither will i go in with dissemblers
i have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit with the wicked
i will wash mine hands in innocency so will i compass thine altar o lord
that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works
lord i have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honour dwelleth
gather not my soul with sinners nor my life with bloody men
in whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of bribes
but as for me i will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be merciful unto me
my foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will i bless the lord
the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid
when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell
though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident
one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to enquire in his temple
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord
hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me
when thou saidst seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek
hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation
when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up
teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty
i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living
wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord
unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit
hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle
draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbours but mischief is in their hearts
give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavours give them after the work of their hands render to them their desert
because they regard not the works of the lord nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up
blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications
the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will i praise him
the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed

the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless his people with peace
i will extol thee o lord for thou hast lifted me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me
o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me
o lord thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit
sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
for his anger endureth but a moment in his favour is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
and in my prosperity i said i shall never be moved
lord by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled
i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication
what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth
hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper
thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness
bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be thou my strong rock for an house of defence to save me
for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me
pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for thou art my strength
into thine hand i commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord god of truth
i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the lord
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my feet in a large room
have mercy upon me o lord for i am in trouble mine eye is consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly
for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed
i was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me without fled from me
i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel
for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life
but i trusted in thee o lord i said thou art my god
my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me
make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy mercies sake
let me not be ashamed o lord for i have called upon thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave
let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous
oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues
blessed be the lord for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city
for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee
o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer
be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the lord
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered
blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile
when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer selah
i acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin selah
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him
thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance selah
i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with mine eye
be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee
many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the lord mercy shall compass him about
be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart
rejoice in the lord o ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright
praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings
sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise
for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in truth
he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the lord
by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth up the depth in storehouses
let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him
for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast
the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he maketh the devices of the people of none effect
the counsel of the lord standeth for ever the thoughts of his heart to all generations
blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance
the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth
he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their works
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength
an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength
behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy
to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine
our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield
for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name
let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee
i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth
my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad
o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together
i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears
they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed
this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them
o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him
o fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him
the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing
come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord
what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good
keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile
depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it
the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry
the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth
the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all
he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken
evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate
the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate
plead my cause o lord with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against me
take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine help
draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that persecute me say unto my soul i am thy salvation
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt
let them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the lord chase them
let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the lord persecute them
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit which without cause they have digged for my soul
let destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fall
and my soul shall be joyful in the lord it shall rejoice in his salvation
all my bones shall say lord who is like unto thee which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him
false witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that i knew not
they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul
but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own bosom
i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother i bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother
but in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me and i knew it not they did tear me and ceased not
with hypocritical mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with their teeth
lord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their destructions my darling from the lions
i will give thee thanks in the great congregation i will praise thee among much people
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause
for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land
yea they opened their mouth wide against me and said aha aha our eye hath seen it
this thou hast seen o lord keep not silence o lord be not far from me
stir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my cause my god and my lord
judge me o lord my god according to thy righteousness and let them not rejoice over me
let them not say in their hearts ah so would we have it let them not say we have swallowed him up
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me
let them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteous cause yea let them say continually let the lord be magnified which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hateful
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off to be wise and to do good
he deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way that is not good he abhorreth not evil
thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds
thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep o lord thou preservest man and beast
how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see light
o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart
let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked remove me
there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down and shall not be able to rise
fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb
trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed
delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart
commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noonday
rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass
cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth
for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be
but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace
the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth
the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming
the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright conversation
their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous
the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be for ever
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied
but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away
the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off
the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way
though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread
he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed
depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore
for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off
the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment
the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide
the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him
the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged
wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it
i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree
yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found
mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off
but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble
and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him
o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure
for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin
for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me
my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness
i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no soundness in my flesh
i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart
lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee
my heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of mine eyes it also is gone from me
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my kinsmen stand afar off
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day long
but i as a deaf man heard not and i was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth
thus i was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs
for in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god
for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me
for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me
for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin
but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because i follow the thing that good is
forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me
make haste to help me o lord my salvation
i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me
i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred
my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned then spake i with my tongue
lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am
behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity selah
surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them
and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee
deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish
i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it
remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thine hand
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity selah
hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were
o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more
i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings
and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord
blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies
many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to usward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered
sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required
then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me
i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart
i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest
i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation
withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me
for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me
be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help me
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil
let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me aha aha
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified
but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god
blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble
the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies
the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness
i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee
mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name perish
and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it
all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt
an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more
yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me
but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them
by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth not triumph over me
and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for ever
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to everlasting amen and amen
as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god
my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god
my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god
when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance
o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the hill mizar
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me
yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life
i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy
as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god
judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man
for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy
o send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles
then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god
we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour unto them
thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob
through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us
for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me
but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to shame that hated us
in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever selah
but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth with our armies
thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate us spoil for themselves
thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast scattered us among the heathen
thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy wealth by their price
thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us
thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head among the people
my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath covered me
for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and avenger
all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant
our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way
though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death
if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our hands to a strange god
shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart
yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter
awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for ever
wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppression
for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto the earth
arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake
my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer
thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever
gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things
thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies whereby the people fall under thee
thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre
thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad
kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir
hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy father's house
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord and worship thou him
and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour
the king's daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold
she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king's palace
instead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth
i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever
god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble
therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah
there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high
god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early
the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah
come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire
be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah
o clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice of triumph
for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth
he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet
he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob whom he loved selah
god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet
sing praises to god sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises
for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with understanding
god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness
the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god he is greatly exalted
great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness
beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king
god is known in her palaces for a refuge
for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together
they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and hasted away
fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail
thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind
as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the city of our god god will establish it for ever selah
we have thought of thy lovingkindness o god in the midst of thy temple
according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness
let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad because of thy judgments
walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers thereof
mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation following
for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide even unto death
hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the world
both low and high rich and poor together
my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding
i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying upon the harp
wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about
they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches
none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god a ransom for him
for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for ever
that he should still live for ever and not see corruption
for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others
their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own names
nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the beasts that perish
this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings selah
like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling
but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he shall receive me selah
be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him
though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself
he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see light
man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish
the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof
out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined
our god shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him
he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that he may judge his people
gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice
and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge himself selah
hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me
i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds
for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills
i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine
if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereof
will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats
offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high
and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me
but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth
seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind thee
when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterers
thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit
thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mother's son
these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes
now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god
have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions
wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me
against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest
behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me
behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom
purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow
make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice
hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities
create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me
cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit
then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee
deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness
o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise
for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burnt offering
the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise
do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem
then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar
why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness of god endureth continually
thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully
thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah
thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living selah
the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him
lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness
but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever
i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good
god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek god
every one of them is gone back they are altogether become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon god
there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because god hath despised them
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad
save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength
hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth
for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set god before them selah
behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my soul
he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy truth
i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o lord for it is good
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies
give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication
attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a noise
because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me
my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me
and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest
lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah
i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest
destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen violence and strife in the city
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it
wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streets
for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him
but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance
we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god in company
let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them
as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me
evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice
he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me
god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him he hath broken his covenant
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords
cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee
be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me
mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high
what time i am afraid i will trust in thee
in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me
every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil
they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul
shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people o god
thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book
when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i know for god is for me
in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his word
in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do unto me
thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee
for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light of the living
be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpast
i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me
he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and his truth
my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth
they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves selah
my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise
awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early
i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth
do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge uprightly o ye sons of men
yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth
the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies
their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely
break their teeth o god in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lions o lord
let them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces
as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun
before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked
so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth
deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that rise up against me
deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men
for lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o lord
they run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help me and behold
thou therefore o lord god of hosts the god of israel awake to visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors selah
they return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go round about the city
behold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their lips for who say they doth hear
but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the heathen in derision
because of his strength will i wait upon thee for god is my defence
the god of my mercy shall prevent me god shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies
slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down o lord our shield
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak
consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth selah
and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the city
let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not satisfied
but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble
unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence and the god of my mercy
o god thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast been displeased o turn thyself to us again
thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal the breaches thereof for it shaketh
thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth selah
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
gilead is mine and manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe philistia triumph thou because of me
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom
wilt not thou o god which hadst cast us off and thou o god which didst not go out with our armies
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies
hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer
from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i
for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy
i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever i will trust in the covert of thy wings selah
for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name
thou wilt prolong the king's life and his years as many generations
he shall abide before god for ever o prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him
so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever that i may daily perform my vows
truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be greatly moved
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly selah
my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be moved
in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god
trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah
surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity
trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them
god hath spoken once twice have i heard this that power belongeth unto god
also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his work
o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is
to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee
thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name
my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches
because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice
my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me
but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth
they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes
but the king shall rejoice in god every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped
hear my voice o god in my prayer preserve my life from fear of the enemy
hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity
who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter words
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not
they encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of laying snares privily they say who shall see them
they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep
but god shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all that see them shall flee away
and all men shall fear and shall declare the work of god for they shall wisely consider of his doing
the righteous shall be glad in the lord and shall trust in him and all the upright in heart shall glory
praise waiteth for thee o god in sion and unto thee shall the vow be performed
o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come
iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them away
blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us o god of our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar off upon the sea
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains being girded with power
which stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves and the tumult of the people
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice
thou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest it with the river of god which is full of water thou preparest them corn when thou hast so provided for it
thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly thou settlest the furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers thou blessest the springing thereof

o bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to be heard
which holdeth our soul in life and suffereth not our feet to be moved
for thou o god hast proved us thou hast tried us as silver is tried
thou broughtest us into the net thou laidst affliction upon our loins
thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place
i will go into thy house with burnt offerings i will pay thee my vows
which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when i was in trouble
i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah
come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he hath done for my soul
i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue
if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me
but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer
blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me
god be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine upon us selah
that thy way may be known upon earth thy saving health among all nations
let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise thee
o let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth selah
let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise thee
then shall the earth yield her increase and god even our own god shall bless us
god shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall fear him
let god arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him
as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god
but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yea let them exceedingly rejoice
sing unto god sing praises to his name extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him
a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is god in his holy habitation
god setteth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land
o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst march through the wilderness selah
the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel
thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary
thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor
the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it
kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil
though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold
when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in salmon
the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the hill of bashan
why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever
the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place
thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them
blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation selah
he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death
but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses
the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea
that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and the tongue of thy dogs in the same
they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my king in the sanctuary
the singers went before the players on instruments followed after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels
bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the fountain of israel
there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of naphtali
thy god hath commanded thy strength strengthen o god that which thou hast wrought for us
because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee
rebuke the company of spearmen the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of silver scatter thou the people that delight in war
princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto god
sing unto god ye kingdoms of the earth o sing praises unto the lord selah

ascribe ye strength unto god his excellency is over israel and his strength is in the clouds
o god thou art terrible out of thy holy places the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be god
save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul
i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me
i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away
o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee
let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel
because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face
i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach
i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them
they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song of the drunkards
but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation
deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters
let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me
hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies
and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily
draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies
thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before thee
reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none
they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink
let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap
let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake
pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them
let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness
let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous
but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation o god set me up on high
i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving
this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs
the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek god
for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners
let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing that moveth therein
for god will save zion and will build the cities of judah that they may dwell there and have it in possession
the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell therein
make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt
let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say aha aha
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified
but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to confusion
deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me
be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress
deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth
by thee have i been holden up from the womb thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually of thee
i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge
let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day
cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth
for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together
saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him
o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt
but i will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more
my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof
i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only
o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works
now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to every one that is to come
thy righteousness also o god is very high who hast done great things o god who is like unto thee
thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth
thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side
i will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth o my god unto thee will i sing with the harp o thou holy one of israel
my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemed
my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt
give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto the king's son
he shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgment
the mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousness
he shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure throughout all generations
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earth
in his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dust
the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts
yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve him
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper
he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight
and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall he be praised
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth
his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessed
blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth wondrous things
and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen
the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended
truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart
but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped
for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked
for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm
they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment
their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish
they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily
they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth
therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them
and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high
behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches
verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency
for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning
if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children
when i thought to know this it was too painful for me
until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end
surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down into destruction
how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors
as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image
thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins
so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee
nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand
thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory
whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee
my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever
for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee
but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works
o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture
remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion wherein thou hast dwelt
lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground
they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land
we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long
o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever
why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom
for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth
thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters
thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness
thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty rivers
the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun
thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter
remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name
o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever
have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty
o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name
arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily
forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually
unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare
when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear up the pillars of it selah
i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn
lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck
for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south
but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up another
for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them
but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of jacob
all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted
in judah is god known his name is great in israel
in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion
there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle selah
thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey
the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands
at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep
thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry
thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven the earth feared and was still
when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth selah
surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain
vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared
he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earth
i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted
i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed selah
thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak
i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times
i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine own heart and my spirit made diligent search
will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no more
is his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for evermore
hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies selah
and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high
i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old
i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings
thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as our god
thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people
thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah
the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled
the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook
thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known
thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron
give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth
i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old
which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us
we will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done
for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children
that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children
that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments
and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god
the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle
they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his law
and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them
marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan
he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire
he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths
he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers
and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness
and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust
yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a table in the wilderness
behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people
therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel
because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation
though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven
and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them of the corn of heaven
man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power he brought in the south wind
he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations
so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desire
they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat was yet in their mouths
the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel
for all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous works
therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in trouble
when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and enquired early after god
and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues
for their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenant
but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath
for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again
how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert
yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel
they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy
how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan
and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drink
he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them
he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locust
he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees with frost
he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts
he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them
he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence
and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham
but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock
and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchased
he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents
yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not his testimonies
but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow
for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images
when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel
so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men
and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy's hand
he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance
the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage
their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation
then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproach
moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim
but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established for ever
he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds
from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands
o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth
their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and there was none to bury them
we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about us
how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like fire
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name
for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place
o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low
help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy name's sake
wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations
give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us
turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved
o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people
thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears to drink in great measure
thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies laugh among themselves
turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved
thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it
thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the land
the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars
she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river
why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her
the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it
return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine
and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself
it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself
so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name
turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved
sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob
take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psaltery
blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day
for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob
this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood not
i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the pots
thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of meribah selah
hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wilt hearken unto me
there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any strange god
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it
but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would none of me
so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counsels
oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways
i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries
the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured for ever
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods
how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked selah
defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy
deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked
they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course
i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high
but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes
arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations
keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not still o god
for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head
they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones
they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance
for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee
the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes
gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre
assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of lot selah
do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin at the brook of kison
which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth
make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their princes as zebah and as zalmunna
who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in possession
o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind
as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire
so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy storm
fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord
let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perish
that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth
how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts
my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god
yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god
blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee selah
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them
who passing through the valley of baca make it a well the rain also filleth the pools
they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appeareth before god
o lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob selah
behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness
for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly
o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee
lord thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought back the captivity of jacob
thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin selah
thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger
turn us o god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease
wilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations
wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee
shew us thy mercy o lord and grant us thy salvation
i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to folly
surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land
mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other
truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven
yea the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her increase
righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps
bow down thine ear o lord hear me for i am poor and needy
preserve my soul for i am holy o thou my god save thy servant that trusteth in thee
be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily
rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul
for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee
give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications
in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou wilt answer me
among the gods there is none like unto thee o lord neither are there any works like unto thy works
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name
for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god alone
teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name
i will praise thee o lord my god with all my heart and i will glorify thy name for evermore
for great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell
o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them
but thou o lord art a god full of compassion and gracious long suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth
o turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thine handmaid
shew me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou lord hast holpen me and comforted me
his foundation is in the holy mountains
the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob
glorious things are spoken of thee o city of god selah
i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there
and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her
the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there selah
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there all my springs are in thee
o lord god of my salvation i have cried day and night before thee
let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry
for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave
i am counted with them that go down into the pit i am as a man that hath no strength
free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand
thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps
thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves selah
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction lord i have called daily upon thee i have stretched out my hands unto thee
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and praise thee selah
shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy faithfulness in destruction
shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness
but unto thee have i cried o lord and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee
lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face from me
i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer thy terrors i am distracted
thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off
they came round about me daily like water they compassed me about together
lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine acquaintance into darkness
i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations
for i have said mercy shall be built up for ever thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens
i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my servant
thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations selah
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o lord thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him
o lord god of hosts who is a strong lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee
thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them
thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm
the heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them
the north and the south thou hast created them tabor and hermon shall rejoice in thy name
thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand
justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and truth shall go before thy face
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk o lord in the light of thy countenance
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted
for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted
for the lord is our defence and the holy one of israel is our king
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one and saidst i have laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of the people
i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed him
with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall strengthen him
the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness afflict him
and i will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my name shall his horn be exalted
i will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers
he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation
also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth
my mercy will i keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall stand fast with him
his seed also will i make to endure for ever and his throne as the days of heaven
if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments
if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments
then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes
nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail
my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips
once have i sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david
his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me
it shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven selah
but thou hast cast off and abhorred thou hast been wroth with thine anointed
thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground
thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin
all that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his neighbours
thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice
thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle
thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to the ground
the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him with shame selah
how long lord wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath burn like fire
remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men in vain
what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah
lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest unto david in thy truth
remember lord the reproach of thy servants how i do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people
wherewith thine enemies have reproached o lord wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed
blessed be the lord for evermore amen and amen
lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations
before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god
thou turnest man to destruction and sayest return ye children of men
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night
thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up
in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it is cut down and withereth
for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we troubled
thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told
the days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away
who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath
so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
return o lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants
o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil
let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children
and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands establish thou it
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty
i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust
surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence
he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday
a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee
only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked
because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation
there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name
he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him
with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation
it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name o most high
to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night
upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon the harp with a solemn sound
for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands
o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this
when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever
but thou lord art most high for evermore
for lo thine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh oil
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon
those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing
to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him
the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved
thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting
the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves
the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea than the mighty waves of the sea
thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house o lord for ever
o lord god to whom vengeance belongeth o god to whom vengeance belongeth shew thyself
lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud
lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph
how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves
they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine heritage
they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless
yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of jacob regard it
understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will ye be wise
he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see
he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know
the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity
blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest him out of thy law
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked
for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance
but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the upright in heart shall follow it
who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity
unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence
when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up
in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frameth mischief by a law
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood
but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut them off in their own wickedness yea the lord our god shall cut them off
o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms
for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods
in his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the hills is his also
the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry land
o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker
for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand to day if ye will hear his voice
harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness
when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work
forty years long was i grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways
unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest
o sing unto the lord a new song sing unto the lord all the earth
sing unto the lord bless his name shew forth his salvation from day to day
declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among all people
for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods
for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens
honour and majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
give unto the lord o ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come into his courts
o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth
say among the heathen that the lord reigneth the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved he shall judge the people righteously
let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar and the fulness thereof
let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
before the lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth
the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad thereof
clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne
a fire goeth before him and burneth up his enemies round about
his lightnings enlightened the world the earth saw and trembled
the hills melted like wax at the presence of the lord at the presence of the lord of the whole earth
the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory
confounded be all they that serve graven images that boast themselves of idols worship him all ye gods
zion heard and was glad and the daughters of judah rejoiced because of thy judgments o lord
for thou lord art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods
ye that love the lord hate evil he preserveth the souls of his saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked
light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart
rejoice in the lord ye righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
o sing unto the lord a new song for he hath done marvellous things his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory
the lord hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen
he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god
make a joyful noise unto the lord all the earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise
sing unto the lord with the harp with the harp and the voice of a psalm
with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord the king
let the sea roar and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein
let the floods clap their hands let the hills be joyful together
before the lord for he cometh to judge the earth with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity
the lord reigneth let the people tremble he sitteth between the cherubims let the earth be moved
the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people
let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy
the king's strength also loveth judgment thou dost establish equity thou executest judgment and righteousness in jacob
exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy
moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call upon his name they called upon the lord and he answered them
he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them
thou answeredst them o lord our god thou wast a god that forgavest them though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions
exalt the lord our god and worship at his holy hill for the lord our god is holy
make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands
serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing
know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture
enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name
for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations
i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing
i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way o when wilt thou come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart
i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me
a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person
whoso privily slandereth his neighbour him will i cut off him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer
mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight
i will early destroy all the wicked of the land that i may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the lord
hear my prayer o lord and let my cry come unto thee
hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily
for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as an hearth
my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget to eat my bread
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin
i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the desert
i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top
mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me
for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping
because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down
my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass
but thou o lord shalt endure for ever and thy remembrance unto all generations
thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favour her yea the set time is come
for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereof
so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory
when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory
he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer
this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the lord behold the earth
to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death
to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem
when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord
he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days
i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations
of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands
they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed
but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end
the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee
bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name
bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits
who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's
the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed
he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel
the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy
he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever
he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities
for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him
as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us
like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them that fear him
for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust
as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth
for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more
but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children
to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them
the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all
bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word
bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure
bless the lord all his works in all places of his dominion bless the lord o my soul
bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honour and majesty
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind
who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fire
who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for ever
thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains
at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
they go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them
thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earth
he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills
they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches
he watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth man's heart
the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted
where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house
the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies
he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down
thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth
the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from god
the sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them down in their dens
man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening
o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches
so is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts
there go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast made to play therein
these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season
that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand they are filled with good
thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust
thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the earth
the glory of the lord shall endure for ever the lord shall rejoice in his works
he looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the hills and they smoke
i will sing unto the lord as long as i live i will sing praise to my god while i have my being
my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the lord
let the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the wicked be no more bless thou the lord o my soul praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people
sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord
seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore
remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth
o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his chosen
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations
which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac
and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant
saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance
when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it
when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people
he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes
saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm
moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread
he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant
whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron
until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him
the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free
he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance
to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdom
israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham
and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies
he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with his servants
he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen
they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of ham
he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his word
he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish
their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings
he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all their coasts
he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land
he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the trees of their coasts
he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that without number
and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground
he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength
he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes
egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them
he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night
the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven
he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river
for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant
and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladness
and gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the labour of the people
that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws praise ye the lord
praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can shew forth all his praise
blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times
remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people o visit me with thy salvation
that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance
we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly
our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea
nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known
he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left
then believed they his words they sang his praise
they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel
but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert
and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul
they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the lord
the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram
and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked
they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass
they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in egypt
wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the red sea
therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them
yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word
but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord
therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness
to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter them in the lands
they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague brake in upon them
then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed
and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore
they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went ill with moses for their sakes
because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips
they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord commanded them
but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works
and they served their idols which were a snare unto them
yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils
and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood
thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions
therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that hated them ruled over them
their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their hand
many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity
nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry
and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies
he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives
save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy
and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in
hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses
and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron
because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned the counsel of the most high
therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell down and there was none to help
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bands in sunder
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder
fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses
he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing
they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters
these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep
for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof
they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble
they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses
he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still
then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders
he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground
a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitation
and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increase
he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease
again they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow
he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock
the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth
whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord
o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with my glory
awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early
i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing praises unto thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and answer me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe over philistia will i triumph
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom
wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou o god go forth with our hosts
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies
hold not thy peace o god of my praise
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue
they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause
for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto prayer
and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love
set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right hand
when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his prayer become sin
let his days be few and let another take his office
let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow
let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places
let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the strangers spoil his labour
let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children
let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following let their name be blotted out
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out
let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth
because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart
as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones
let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and of them that speak evil against my soul
but do thou for me o god the lord for thy name's sake because thy mercy is good deliver thou me
for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me
i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust
my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness
i became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me they shaked their heads
help me o lord my god o save me according to thy mercy
that they may know that this is thy hand that thou lord hast done it
let them curse but bless thou when they arise let them be ashamed but let thy servant rejoice
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle
i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth yea i will praise him among the multitude
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor to save him from those that condemn his soul
the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool

in my distress i cried unto the lord and he heard me
deliver my soul o lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue
what shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue
sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper
woe is me that i sojourn in mesech that i dwell in the tents of kedar
my soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace
i am for peace but when i speak they are for war
i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help
my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber
behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep
the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand
the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night
the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul
the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even for evermore
i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord
our feet shall stand within thy gates o jerusalem
jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together
whither the tribes go up the tribes of the lord unto the testimony of israel to give thanks unto the name of the lord
for there are set thrones of judgment the thrones of the house of david
pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee
peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces
for my brethren and companions sakes i will now say peace be within thee
because of the house of the lord our god i will seek thy good
unto thee lift i up mine eyes o thou that dwellest in the heavens
behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the lord our god until that he have mercy upon us
have mercy upon us o lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud
if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say
if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us
then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us
then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul
then the proud waters had gone over our soul
blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth
our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped
our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth
they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot be removed but abideth for ever
as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity
do good o lord unto those that be good and to them that are upright in their hearts
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be upon israel
when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream
then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the heathen the lord hath done great things for them
the lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad
turn again our captivity o lord as the streams in the south
they that sow in tears shall reap in joy
he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him
except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain
it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep
lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward
as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate
blessed is every one that feareth the lord that walketh in his ways
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house thy children like olive plants round about thy table
behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the lord
the lord shall bless thee out of zion and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the days of thy life
yea thou shalt see thy children's children and peace upon israel
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth may israel now say
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth yet they have not prevailed against me
the plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows
the lord is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked
let them all be confounded and turned back that hate zion
let them be as the grass upon the housetops which withereth afore it groweth up
wherewith the mower filleth not his hand nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom
neither do they which go by say the blessing of the lord be upon you we bless you in the name of the lord
out of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord
lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications
if thou lord shouldest mark iniquities o lord who shall stand
but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared
i wait for the lord my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope
my soul waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning
let israel hope in the lord for with the lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption
and he shall redeem israel from all his iniquities
lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me
surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child
let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and for ever
lord remember david and all his afflictions
how he sware unto the lord and vowed unto the mighty god of jacob
surely i will not come into the tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed
i will not give sleep to mine eyes or slumber to mine eyelids
until i find out a place for the lord an habitation for the mighty god of jacob
lo we heard of it at ephratah we found it in the fields of the wood
we will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his footstool
arise o lord into thy rest thou and the ark of thy strength
let thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let thy saints shout for joy
for thy servant david's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed
the lord hath sworn in truth unto david he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that i shall teach them their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore
for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation
this is my rest for ever here will i dwell for i have desired it
i will abundantly bless her provision i will satisfy her poor with bread
i will also clothe her priests with salvation and her saints shall shout aloud for joy
there will i make the horn of david to bud i have ordained a lamp for mine anointed
his enemies will i clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish
behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity
it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments
as the dew of hermon and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life for evermore
behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord which by night stand in the house of the lord
lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord
the lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of zion
praise ye the lord praise ye the name of the lord praise him o ye servants of the lord
ye that stand in the house of the lord in the courts of the house of our god
praise the lord for the lord is good sing praises unto his name for it is pleasant
for the lord hath chosen jacob unto himself and israel for his peculiar treasure
for i know that the lord is great and that our lord is above all gods
whatsoever the lord pleased that did he in heaven and in earth in the seas and all deep places
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings for the rain he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries
who smote the firstborn of egypt both of man and beast
who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee o egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his servants
who smote great nations and slew mighty kings
sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and all the kingdoms of canaan
and gave their land for an heritage an heritage unto israel his people
thy name o lord endureth for ever and thy memorial o lord throughout all generations
for the lord will judge his people and he will repent himself concerning his servants
the idols of the heathen are silver and gold the work of men's hands
they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not
they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath in their mouths
they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them
bless the lord o house of israel bless the lord o house of aaron
bless the lord o house of levi ye that fear the lord bless the lord
blessed be the lord out of zion which dwelleth at jerusalem praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
o give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth for ever
o give thanks to the lord of lords for his mercy endureth for ever

to him that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth for ever
to him that stretched out the earth above the waters for his mercy endureth for ever
to him that made great lights for his mercy endureth for ever
the sun to rule by day for his mercy endureth for ever
the moon and stars to rule by night for his mercy endureth for ever
to him that smote egypt in their firstborn for his mercy endureth for ever
and brought out israel from among them for his mercy endureth for ever
with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm for his mercy endureth for ever
to him which divided the red sea into parts for his mercy endureth for ever
and made israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy endureth for ever
but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the red sea for his mercy endureth for ever
to him which led his people through the wilderness for his mercy endureth for ever
to him which smote great kings for his mercy endureth for ever
and slew famous kings for his mercy endureth for ever
sihon king of the amorites for his mercy endureth for ever
and og the king of bashan for his mercy endureth for ever
and gave their land for an heritage for his mercy endureth for ever
even an heritage unto israel his servant for his mercy endureth for ever
who remembered us in our low estate for his mercy endureth for ever
and hath redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth for ever
who giveth food to all flesh for his mercy endureth for ever
o give thanks unto the god of heaven for his mercy endureth for ever
by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion
how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land
if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning
if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy
remember o lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof
o daughter of babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us
happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones
i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee
i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name
in the day when i cried thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul
all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth
yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the glory of the lord
though the lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off
though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me
the lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy o lord endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands
o lord thou hast searched me and known me
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou understandest my thought afar off
thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways
for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it altogether
thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me
such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it
whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence
if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there
if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me
if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me
yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee
for thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my mother's womb
i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well
my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them
if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee
surely thou wilt slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloody men
for they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take thy name in vain
do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee
i hate them with perfect hatred i count them mine enemies
search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts
and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting
deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man
which imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they gathered together for war
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison is under their lips selah
keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goings
the proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a net by the wayside they have set gins for me selah
i said unto the lord thou art my god hear the voice of my supplications o lord
o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day of battle
grant not o lord the desires of the wicked further not his wicked device lest they exalt themselves selah
as for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief of their own lips cover them
let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the fire into deep pits that they rise not up again
let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him
i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor
surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the upright shall dwell in thy presence
lord i cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when i cry unto thee
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
set a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips
incline not my heart to any evil thing to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties
let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
when their judges are overthrown in stony places they shall hear my words for they are sweet
our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth
but mine eyes are unto thee o god the lord in thee is my trust leave not my soul destitute
keep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the gins of the workers of iniquity
let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that i withal escape
i cried unto the lord with my voice with my voice unto the lord did i make my supplication
i poured out my complaint before him i shewed before him my trouble
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path in the way wherein i walked have they privily laid a snare for me
i looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul
i cried unto thee o lord i said thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living
attend unto my cry for i am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than i
bring my soul out of prison that i may praise thy name the righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with me
hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness
and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate
i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works i muse on the work of thy hands
i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land selah
hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit
cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee
deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me
teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness
quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble
and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant
blessed be the lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight
my goodness and my fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom i trust who subdueth my people under me
lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him
man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth away
bow thy heavens o lord and come down touch the mountains and they shall smoke
cast forth lightning and scatter them shoot out thine arrows and destroy them
send thine hand from above rid me and deliver me out of great waters from the hand of strange children
whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
i will sing a new song unto thee o god upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee
it is he that giveth salvation unto kings who delivereth david his servant from the hurtful sword
rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as corner stones polished after the similitude of a palace
that our garners may be full affording all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets
that our oxen may be strong to labour that there be no breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining in our streets
happy is that people that is in such a case yea happy is that people whose god is the lord
i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name for ever and ever
every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name for ever and ever
great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable
one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts
i will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works
and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and i will declare thy greatness
they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness
the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy
the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works
all thy works shall praise thee o lord and thy saints shall bless thee
they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom
thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations
the lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down
the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their meat in due season
thou openest thine hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing
the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works
the lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them
the lord preserveth all them that love him but all the wicked will he destroy
my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever
praise ye the lord praise the lord o my soul
while i live will i praise the lord i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being
put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help
his breath goeth forth he returneth to his earth in that very day his thoughts perish
happy is he that hath the god of jacob for his help whose hope is in the lord his god
which made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth for ever
which executeth judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the lord looseth the prisoners
the lord openeth the eyes of the blind the lord raiseth them that are bowed down the lord loveth the righteous
the lord preserveth the strangers he relieveth the fatherless and widow but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down
the lord shall reign for ever even thy god o zion unto all generations praise ye the lord
praise ye the lord for it is good to sing praises unto our god for it is pleasant and praise is comely
the lord doth build up jerusalem he gathereth together the outcasts of israel
he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds
he telleth the number of the stars he calleth them all by their names
great is our lord and of great power his understanding is infinite
the lord lifteth up the meek he casteth the wicked down to the ground
sing unto the lord with thanksgiving sing praise upon the harp unto our god
who covereth the heaven with clouds who prepareth rain for the earth who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains
he giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry
he delighteth not in the strength of the horse he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man
the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him in those that hope in his mercy
praise the lord o jerusalem praise thy god o zion
for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates he hath blessed thy children within thee
he maketh peace in thy borders and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat
he sendeth forth his commandment upon earth his word runneth very swiftly
he giveth snow like wool he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes
he casteth forth his ice like morsels who can stand before his cold
he sendeth out his word and melteth them he causeth his wind to blow and the waters flow
he sheweth his word unto jacob his statutes and his judgments unto israel
he hath not dealt so with any nation and as for his judgments they have not known them praise ye the lord
praise ye the lord praise ye the lord from the heavens praise him in the heights

praise ye him sun and moon praise him all ye stars of light
praise him ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that be above the heavens

mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars
beasts and all cattle creeping things and flying fowl
kings of the earth and all people princes and all judges of the earth

for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation
let the saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds
let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a twoedged sword in their hand
to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people
to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron
to execute upon them the judgment written this honour have all his saints praise ye the lord
praise ye the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power
praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness

let every thing that hath breath praise the lord praise ye the lord
the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel
to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding
to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity
to give subtilty to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion
a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels
to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings
the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction
my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother
for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck
my son if sinners entice thee consent thou not
if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause
let us swallow them up alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit
we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses with spoil
cast in thy lot among us let us all have one purse
my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their path
for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood
surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird
and they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own lives
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which taketh away the life of the owners thereof
wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets
she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying
how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge
turn you at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you
because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded
but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof
i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh
when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you
then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me
for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord
they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices
for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them
but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil
my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with thee
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding
yea if thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding
if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures
then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god
for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly
he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints
then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good path
when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul
discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee
to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh froward things
who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness
who rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked
whose ways are crooked and they froward in their paths
to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with her words
which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth the covenant of her god
for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead
none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the paths of life
that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous
for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall remain in it
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it
my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments
for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee
let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart
so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man
trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding
in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil
it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones
honour the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase
so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine
my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction
for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth
happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding
for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold
she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her
length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour
her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace
she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is every one that retaineth her
the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth by understanding hath he established the heavens
by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dew
my son let not them depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom and discretion
so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck
then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble
when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet
be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh
for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken
withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do it
say not unto thy neighbour go and come again and to morrow i will give when thou hast it by thee
devise not evil against thy neighbour seeing he dwelleth securely by thee
strive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no harm
envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways
for the froward is abomination to the lord but his secret is with the righteous
the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked but he blesseth the habitation of the just
surely he scorneth the scorners but he giveth grace unto the lowly
the wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of fools
hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to know understanding
for i give you good doctrine forsake ye not my law
for i was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother
he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live
get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth
forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee
wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding
exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her
she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee
hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many
i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in right paths
when thou goest thy steps shall not be straitened and when thou runnest thou shalt not stumble
take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life
enter not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men
avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away
for they sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall
for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence
but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day
the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble
my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings
let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart
for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh
keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life
put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee
let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee
ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established
turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil
my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding
that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge
for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil
but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a twoedged sword
her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell
lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are moveable that thou canst not know them
hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from the words of my mouth
remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her house
lest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto the cruel
lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labours be in the house of a stranger
and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed
and say how have i hated instruction and my heart despised reproof
and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me
i was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly
drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well
let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streets
let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee
let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love
and why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger
for the ways of man are before the eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his goings
his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins
he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray
my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger
thou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth
do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friend
give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler
go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise
which having no guide overseer or ruler
provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest
how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep
yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man
a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth
he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers
frowardness is in his heart he deviseth mischief continually he soweth discord
therefore shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy
these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him
a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood
an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief
a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren
my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother
bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck
when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee
for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life
to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman
lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids
for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life
can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned
can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned
so he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent
men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry
but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house
but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul
a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away
for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance
he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou givest many gifts
my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee
keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye
bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heart
say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thy kinswoman
that they may keep thee from the strange woman from the stranger which flattereth with her words
for at the window of my house i looked through my casement
and beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding
passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house
in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night
and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heart
she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house
now is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at every corner
so she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent face said unto him
i have peace offerings with me this day have i payed my vows
therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and i have found thee
i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works with fine linen of egypt
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon
come let us take our fill of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with loves
for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey
he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced him
he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks
till a dart strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not that it is for his life
hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth
let not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her paths
for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by her
her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death
doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice
she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of the paths
she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors
unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of man
o ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an understanding heart
hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things
for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing froward or perverse in them
they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge
receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold
for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it
i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions
the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate
counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength
by me kings reign and princes decree justice
by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth
i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me
riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousness
my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver
i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment
that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures
the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old
i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was
when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water
before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth
while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world
when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth
when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep
when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth
then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him
rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men
now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways
hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not
blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors
for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the lord
but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death
wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars
she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her table
she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the city
whoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him
come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled
forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding
he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot
reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee
give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding
for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased
if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear it
a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing
for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city
to call passengers who go right on their ways
whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him
stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant
but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell
the proverbs of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother
treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from death
the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked
he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich
he that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame
blessings are upon the head of the just but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot
the wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool shall fall
he that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth his ways shall be known
he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool shall fall
the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sins
in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding
wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction
the rich man's wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their poverty
the labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the wicked to sin
he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he that refuseth reproof erreth
he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth a slander is a fool

better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud
he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whoso trusteth in the lord happy is he
the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning
understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it but the instruction of fools is folly
the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and addeth learning to his lips
pleasant words are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones
there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth craveth it of him
an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as a burning fire
a froward man soweth strife and a whisperer separateth chief friends

excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a prince
a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth
he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends
a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool
an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him
let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly
whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house
the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with
he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord
wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom seeing he hath no heart to it
a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity
a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety in the presence of his friend
he loveth transgression that loveth strife and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction
he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief
he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow and the father of a fool hath no joy
a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones
a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment
wisdom is before him that hath understanding but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth
a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her that bare him
also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princes for equity
he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit
even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding
through desire a man having separated himself seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom
a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart may discover itself
when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and with ignominy reproach
the words of a man's mouth are as deep waters and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook
it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in judgment
a fool's lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth for strokes
a fool's mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul
the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster
the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe
the rich man's wealth is his strong city and as an high wall in his own conceit
before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honour is humility
he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto him
the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear
the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge
a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men
he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him
the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between the mighty
a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle
a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled
death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof
whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour of the lord
the poor useth intreaties but the rich answereth roughly
a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother
better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool
also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth
the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart fretteth against the lord
wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from his neighbour
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall not escape
many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts
all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his friends go far from him he pursueth them with words yet they are wanting to him
he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepeth understanding shall find good
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall perish
delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to have rule over princes
the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression
the king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favour is as dew upon the grass
a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping
house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the lord
slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall suffer hunger
he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he that despiseth his ways shall die
he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again
chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying
a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment for if thou deliver him yet thou must do it again
hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end
there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand
the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar
the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil
a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again
smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove one that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge
he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach
cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge
an ungodly witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity
judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools
wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise
the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul
it is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling
the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shall he beg in harvest and have nothing
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out
most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful man who can find
the just man walketh in his integrity his children are blessed after him
a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes
who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin
divers weights and divers measures both of them are alike abomination to the lord
even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right
the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made even both of them
love not sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread
it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gone his way then he boasteth
there is gold and a multitude of rubies but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel
take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman
bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel
every purpose is established by counsel and with good advice make war
he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips
whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness
an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed
say not thou i will recompense evil but wait on the lord and he shall save thee
divers weights are an abomination unto the lord and a false balance is not good
man's goings are of the lord how can a man then understand his own way
it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy and after vows to make enquiry
a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them
the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly
mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden by mercy
the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the grey head
the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly
the king's heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turneth it whithersoever he will
every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts
to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice
an high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin
the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but of every one that is hasty only to want
the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death
the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse to do judgment
the way of man is froward and strange but as for the pure his work is right
it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house
the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes
when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge
the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked but god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness
whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall cry himself but shall not be heard
a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a reward in the bosom strong wrath
it is joy to the just to do judgment but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity
the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead
he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich
the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous and the transgressor for the upright
it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and an angry woman
there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spendeth it up
he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life righteousness and honour
a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof
whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles
proud and haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath
the desire of the slothful killeth him for his hands refuse to labour
he coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and spareth not
the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind
a false witness shall perish but the man that heareth speaketh constantly
a wicked man hardeneth his face but as for the upright he directeth his way
there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the lord
the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the lord
a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favour rather than silver and gold
the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all
a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished
by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honour and life
thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them
train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it
the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender

the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor
the slothful man saith there is a lion without i shall be slain in the streets
the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred of the lord shall fall therein
foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him
he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he that giveth to the rich shall surely come to want
bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise and apply thine heart unto my knowledge
for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee they shall withal be fitted in thy lips
that thy trust may be in the lord i have made known to thee this day even to thee
have not i written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge
that i might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee
rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress the afflicted in the gate
for the lord will plead their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them
make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man thou shalt not go
lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul
be not thou one of them that strike hands or of them that are sureties for debts
if thou hast nothing to pay why should he take away thy bed from under thee
remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set
seest thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men
when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is before thee
and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite
be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat
labour not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom
wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven
eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meats
for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee
the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose thy sweet words
speak not in the ears of a fool for he will despise the wisdom of thy words
remove not the old landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless
for their redeemer is mighty he shall plead their cause with thee
apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge
withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die
thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell
my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine
yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things
let not thine heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the lord all the day long
for surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be cut off
hear thou my son and be wise and guide thine heart in the way
be not among winebibbers among riotous eaters of flesh
for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags
hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she is old
buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding
the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him
thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bare thee shall rejoice
my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways
for a whore is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pit
she also lieth in wait as for a prey and increaseth the transgressors among men
who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath contentions who hath babbling who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes
they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek mixed wine
look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth his colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright
at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder
thine eyes shall behold strange women and thine heart shall utter perverse things

yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man

as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not seemly for a fool
as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse causeless shall not come

the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy the man spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal
surely i am more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man
i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy
who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his son's name if thou canst tell
every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him
add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar
two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die
remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me
lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain
accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guilty
there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their mother

there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men
the horseleach hath two daughters crying give give there are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is enough
the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that saith not it is enough
the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it
there be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which i know not
the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maid
such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness
for three things the earth is disquieted and for four which it cannot bear
for a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he is filled with meat
for an odious woman when she is married and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress
there be four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise
the ants are a people not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer
the conies are but a feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocks
the locusts have no king yet go they forth all of them by bands
the spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces
there be three things which go well yea four are comely in going
a lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not away for any
a greyhound an he goat also and a king against whom there is no rising up
if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thy mouth
surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife
the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him
what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows
give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings
it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink
lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted
give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts
let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more
open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction

the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil
she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life
she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands
she is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afar
she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens
she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard
she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms
she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night
she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth her hands to the needy
she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet
she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple
her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land
she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant
strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come
she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness
she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness
her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her
many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all
favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised
give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates
the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem
vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity
what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun
one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever
the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose
the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuits
all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again
all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun
is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us
there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after
i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem
and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith
i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit
that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered
i communed with mine own heart saying lo i am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge
and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow
i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity
i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it
i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life
i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards
i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kind of fruits
i made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees
i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me
i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts
so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me
and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour and this was my portion of all my labour
then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun
and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already done
then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness
the wise man's eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all
then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why was i then more wise then i said in my heart that this also is vanity
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool
therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
yea i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured and wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun this is also vanity
therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun
for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion this also is vanity and a great evil
for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun
for all his days are sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in the night this is also vanity
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour this also i saw that it was from the hand of god
for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i
for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that is good before god this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven
a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted
a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up
a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance
a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing
a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away
a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak
a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace
what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth
i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end
i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life
and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour it is the gift of god
i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothing can be put to it nor any thing taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him
that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past
and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment that wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity was there
i said in mine heart god shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work
i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that god might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity
all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again
who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth
wherefore i perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him
so i returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter
wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive
yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun
again i considered all travail and every right work that for this a man is envied of his neighbour this is also vanity and vexation of spirit
the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh
better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit
then i returned and i saw vanity under the sun
there is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labour neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do i labour and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea it is a sore travail
two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labour
for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up
again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone
and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken
better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished
for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor
i considered all the living which walk under the sun with the second child that shall stand up in his stead
there is no end of all the people even of all that have been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil
be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words
when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed
better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay
suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error wherefore should god be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands
for in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities but fear thou god
if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than they
moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the field
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity
when goods increase they are increased that eat them and what good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with their eyes
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep
there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt
but those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son and there is nothing in his hand
as he came forth of his mother's womb naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he may carry away in his hand
and this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so shall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind
all his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness
behold that which i have seen it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life which god giveth him for it is his portion
every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of god
for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god answereth him in the joy of his heart
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common among men
a man to whom god hath given riches wealth and honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease
if a man beget an hundred children and live many years so that the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good and also that he have no burial i say that an untimely birth is better than he
for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and his name shall be covered with darkness
moreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hath more rest than the other
yea though he live a thousand years twice told yet hath he seen no good do not all go to one place
all the labour of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled
for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the living
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spirit
that which hath been is named already and it is known that it is man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he
seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the better
for who knoweth what is good for man in this life all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun
a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart
sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanity
surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit
be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools
say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this
wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the sun
for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it
consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked
in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him
all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness
be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyself 
be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all
wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city
for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not
also take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others
all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me
that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out
i applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness
and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her
behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account
which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found
lo this only have i found that god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions
who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed
i counsel thee to keep the king's commandment and that in regard of the oath of god
be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him
where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou
whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment
because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him
for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it
all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt
and so i saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done this is also vanity
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil
though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear before him
but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before god
there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous i said that this also is vanity
then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life which god giveth him under the sun
when i applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes
then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it
for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of god no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them
all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath
this is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead
for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for a living dog is better than a dead lion
for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any thing neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten
also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun
go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for god now accepteth thy works
let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no ointment
live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest
i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all
for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them
this wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seemed great unto me
there was a little city and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it
now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man
then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard
the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools
wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyeth much good
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour
a wise man's heart is at his right hand but a fool's heart at his left
yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he saith to every one that he is a fool
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for yielding pacifieth great offences
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler
folly is set in great dignity and the rich sit in low place
i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedge a serpent shall bite him
whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby
if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct
surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no better
the words of a wise man's mouth are gracious but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is mischievous madness
a fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall be and what shall be after him who can tell him
the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how to go to the city
woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princes eat in the morning
blessed art thou o land when thy king is the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness
by much slothfulness the building decayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through
a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but money answereth all things
curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter
cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days
give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth
if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be
he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all
in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good
truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun
but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is vanity
rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth are vanity
remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them
while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be darkened
and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low
also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets
or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern
then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity
and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth
the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd
and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man
for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil
the song of songs which is solomon's
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine
because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee
draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than wine the upright love thee
i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon
look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath looked upon me my mother's children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept
tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions
if thou know not o thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents
i have compared thee o my love to a company of horses in pharaoh's chariots
thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chains of gold
we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver
while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof
a bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts
my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of engedi
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes
behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is green
the beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir
i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys
as the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste
he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love
stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for i am sick of love
his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me
i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please
the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself through the lattice
my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away
for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone
the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land
the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away
o my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely
take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes
my beloved is mine and i am his he feedeth among the lilies
until the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of bether
by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not
i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not
the watchmen that go about the city found me to whom i said saw ye him whom my soul loveth
it was but a little that i passed from them but i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and would not let him go until i had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her that conceived me
i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please
who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchant
behold his bed which is solomon's threescore valiant men are about it of the valiant of israel
they all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night
king solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon
he made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with love for the daughters of jerusalem
go forth o ye daughters of zion and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount gilead
thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing whereof every one bear twins and none is barren among them
thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy speech is comely thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks
thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armoury whereon there hang a thousand bucklers all shields of mighty men
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins which feed among the lilies
until the day break and the shadows flee away i will get me to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense
thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee
come with me from lebanon my spouse with me from lebanon look from the top of amana from the top of shenir and hermon from the lions dens from the mountains of the leopards
thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck
how fair is thy love my sister my spouse how much better is thy love than wine and the smell of thine ointments than all spices
thy lips o my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of lebanon
a garden inclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed
thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits camphire with spikenard
spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices
a fountain of gardens a well of living waters and streams from lebanon
awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits
i am come into my garden my sister my spouse i have gathered my myrrh with my spice i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have drunk my wine with my milk eat o friends drink yea drink abundantly o beloved
i sleep but my heart waketh it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled for my head is filled with dew and my locks with the drops of the night
i have put off my coat how shall i put it on i have washed my feet how shall i defile them
my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door and my bowels were moved for him
i rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrrh and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock
i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave me no answer
the watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
i charge you o daughters of jerusalem if ye find my beloved that ye tell him that i am sick of love
what is thy beloved more than another beloved o thou fairest among women what is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou dost so charge us
my beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest among ten thousand
his head is as the most fine gold his locks are bushy and black as a raven
his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters washed with milk and fitly set
his cheeks are as a bed of spices as sweet flowers his lips like lilies dropping sweet smelling myrrh
his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires
his legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold his countenance is as lebanon excellent as the cedars
his mouth is most sweet yea he is altogether lovely this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
whither is thy beloved gone o thou fairest among women whither is thy beloved turned aside that we may seek him with thee
my beloved is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies
i am my beloved's and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies
thou art beautiful o my love as tirzah comely as jerusalem terrible as an army with banners
turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from gilead
thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing whereof every one beareth twins and there is not one barren among them
as a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks
there are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins without number
my dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bare her the daughters saw her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines and they praised her
who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners
i went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded
or ever i was aware my soul made me like the chariots of amminadib
return return o shulamite return return that we may look upon thee what will ye see in the shulamite as it were the company of two armies
how beautiful are thy feet with shoes o prince's daughter the joints of thy thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a cunning workman
thy navel is like a round goblet which wanteth not liquor thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins
thy neck is as a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fishpools in heshbon by the gate of bathrabbim thy nose is as the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus
thine head upon thee is like carmel and the hair of thine head like purple the king is held in the galleries
how fair and how pleasant art thou o love for delights
this thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to clusters of grapes
i said i will go up to the palm tree i will take hold of the boughs thereof now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy nose like apples
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved that goeth down sweetly causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak
i am my beloved's and his desire is toward me
come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us lodge in the villages
let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth there will i give thee my loves
the mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits new and old which i have laid up for thee o my beloved
o that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother when i should find thee without i would kiss thee yea i should not be despised
i would lead thee and bring thee into my mother's house who would instruct me i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate
his left hand should be under my head and his right hand should embrace me
i charge you o daughters of jerusalem that ye stir not up nor awake my love until he please
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved i raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare thee
set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame
many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned
we have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for
if she be a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver and if she be a door we will inclose her with boards of cedar
i am a wall and my breasts like towers then was i in his eyes as one that found favour
solomon had a vineyard at baalhamon he let out the vineyard unto keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver
my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon must have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred
thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice cause me to hear it
make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices
the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah
hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the lord hath spoken i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me
the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider
ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward
why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment
your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers
and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city
except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah
hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah
to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats
when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts
bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them
and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood
wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil
learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow
come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool
if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land
but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers
thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water
thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them
therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies
and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin
and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city
zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no water
and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them
the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem
and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it
and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem
and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord
therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the philistines and they please themselves in the children of strangers
their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots
their land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have made
and the mean man boweth down and the great man humbleth himself therefore forgive them not
enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day
for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be brought low
and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan
and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up
and upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall
and upon all the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day
and the idols he shall utterly abolish
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles and to the bats
to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth
cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of 
for behold the lord the lord of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water
the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient
the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator
and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them
and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honourable
when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy hand
in that day shall he swear saying i will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make me not a ruler of the people
for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory
the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves
say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings
woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given him
as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths
the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people
the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses
what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts
moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts
in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon
the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers
the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings
the rings and nose jewels
the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins
the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails
and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty
thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war
and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach
in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel
and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem
when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning
and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence
and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain
now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill
and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes
and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard
what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes
and now go to i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down
and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it
for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry
woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth
in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant
yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them
and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hands
therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst
therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it
and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled
but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness
then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat
woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope
that say let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it
woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight
woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink
which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him
therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of the holy one of israel
therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly
none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken
whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind
their roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof
in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple
above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly
and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke
then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar
and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged
also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me
and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not
make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed
then said i lord how long and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate
and the lord have removed men far away and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land
but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof
and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it
and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind
then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field
and say unto him take heed and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria and of the son of remaliah
because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying
let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeal
thus saith the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass
for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people
and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliah's son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established
moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying
ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above
but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord
and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also
therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel
butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings
the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy father's house days that have not come from the day that ephraim departed from judah even the king of assyria
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria
and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushes
in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired namely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard
and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep
and it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land
and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall even be for briers and thorns
with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thorns
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle
moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write in it with a man's pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz
and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah
and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria
the lord spake also unto me again saying
forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliah's son
now therefore behold the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks
and he shall pass through judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel
associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces
take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for god is with us
for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying
say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say a confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid
sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread
and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem
and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken
bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples
and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him
behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth in mount zion
and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead
to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them
and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their god and look upward
and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darkness
nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations
the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined
thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil
for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire
for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this
the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel
and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart
the bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores are cut down but we will change them into cedars
therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him and join his enemies together
the syrians before and the philistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do they seek the lord of hosts
therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch and rush in one day
the ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet that teacheth lies he is the tail
for the leaders of this people cause them to err and they that are led of them are destroyed
therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke
through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare his brother
and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm
manasseh ephraim and ephraim manasseh and they together shall be against judah for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed
to turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless
and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your glory
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation
i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets
howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few
for he saith are not my princes altogether kings
is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria
shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her idols
wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks
for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man
and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped
shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood
therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire
and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day
and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth
and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write them
and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of israel and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the holy one of israel in truth
the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the mighty god
for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet a remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness
for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption even determined in the midst of all the land
therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt
for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction
and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt
and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing
he is come to aiath he is passed to migron at michmash he hath laid up his carriages
they are gone over the passage they have taken up their lodging at geba ramah is afraid gibeah of saul is fled
lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard unto laish o poor anathoth
madmenah is removed the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee
as yet shall he remain at nob that day he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem
behold the lord the lord of hosts shall lop the bough with terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the haughty shall be humbled
and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots
and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked
and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins
the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them
and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea
and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth
the envy also of ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall not vex ephraim
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them
and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshod
and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt
and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst me
behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation
and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted
sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth
cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee
the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles
i have commanded my sanctified ones i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highness
the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle
they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land
howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty
therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt
and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames
behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine
and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible
i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of ophir
therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger
and it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every one into his own land
every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished
behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eye shall not spare children
and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah
it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolonged
for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob
and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors
and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve
that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased
the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulers
he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth
the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing
yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations
all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us
thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee
how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations
for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north
i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high
yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms
that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners
all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own house
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden under feet
thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with cities
for i will rise up against them saith the lord of hosts and cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith the lord
i will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the lord of hosts
the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand
that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations
for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back
in the year that king ahaz died was this burden
rejoice not thou whole palestina because the rod of him that smote thee is broken for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and he shall slay thy remnant
howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed times
what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation that the lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust in it
the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laid waste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab is laid waste and brought to silence
he is gone up to bajith and to dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo and over medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut off
in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantly
and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out his life shall be grievous unto him
my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee unto zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction
for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing
therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows
for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim
for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bring more upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the remnant of the land
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion
for it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon
take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that wandereth
let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land
and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seeking judgment and hasting righteousness
we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be so
therefore shall moab howl for moab every one shall howl for the foundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken
for the fields of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof they are come even unto jazer they wandered through the wilderness her branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea
therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen
and gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses i have made their vintage shouting to cease
wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab and mine inward parts for kirharesh
and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weary on the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he shall not prevail
this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab since that time
but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as the years of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned with all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and feeble
the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap
the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid
the fortress also shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of the children of israel saith the lord of hosts
and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim
yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lord god of israel
at that day shall a man look to his maker and his eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel
and he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the groves or the images
in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of israel and there shall be desolation
because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips

woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind
and behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is not this is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that rob us
woe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia
that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters saying go ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers have spoiled
all ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye
for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest
for afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches
they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them
in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the lord of hosts the mount zion
the burden of egypt behold the lord rideth upon a swift cloud and shall come into egypt and the idols of egypt shall be moved at his presence and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it
and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbour city against city and kingdom against kingdom
and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and i will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards
and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of hosts
and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and dried up
and they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall wither
the paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be no more
the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish
moreover they that work in fine flax and they that weave networks shall be confounded
and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make sluices and ponds for fish
surely the princes of zoan are fools the counsel of the wise counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto pharaoh i am the son of the wise the son of ancient kings

the princes of zoan are become fools the princes of noph are deceived they have also seduced egypt even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof
the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit
neither shall there be any work for egypt which the head or tail branch or rush may do
in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts which he shaketh over it
and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of the lord of hosts which he hath determined against it
in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall be called the city of destruction
in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord
and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them
and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea they shall vow a vow unto the lord and perform it
and the lord shall smite egypt he shall smite and heal it and they shall return even to the lord and he shall be intreated of them and shall heal them
in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians
in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria even a blessing in the midst of the land
whom the lord of hosts shall bless saying blessed be egypt my people and assyria the work of my hands and israel mine inheritance
in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the king of assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it
at the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz saying go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot
and the lord said like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia
so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt
and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation and of egypt their glory
and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day behold such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria and how shall we escape

my heart panted fearfulness affrighted me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me
prepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise ye princes and anoint the shield
for thus hath the lord said unto me go set a watchman let him declare what he seeth
and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen a chariot of asses and a chariot of camels and he hearkened diligently with much heed
and he cried a lion my lord i stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime and i am set in my ward whole nights
and behold here cometh a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen and he answered and said babylon is fallen is fallen and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground

and the residue of the number of archers the mighty men of the children of kedar shall be diminished for the lord god of israel hath spoken it
the burden of the valley of vision what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops
thou that art full of stirs a tumultuous city a joyous city thy slain men are not slain with the sword nor dead in battle
all thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers all that are found in thee are bound together which have fled from far

and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall
ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago
and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth
and behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall die

and i will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and i will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah
and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open
and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons

and by great waters the seed of sihor the harvest of the river is her revenue and she is a mart of nations
be thou ashamed o zidon for the sea hath spoken even the strength of the sea saying i travail not nor bring forth children neither do i nourish up young men nor bring up virgins

who hath taken this counsel against tyre the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth
the lord of hosts hath purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth
pass through thy land as a river o daughter of tarshish there is no more strength

take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be remembered
and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that the lord will visit tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth
and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing

therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left
the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryhearted do sigh
the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth
they shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it
the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up that no man may come in
there is a crying for wine in the streets all joy is darkened the mirth of the land is gone
in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done

the earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth
and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited
then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously
o lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy name for thou hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth
for thou hast made of a city an heap of a defenced city a ruin a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be built
therefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee
for thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall
thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low
and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations
he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it
and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation
for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest and moab shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands
and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust
in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city salvation will god appoint for walls and bulwarks

the way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost weigh the path of the just
yea in the way of thy judgments o lord have we waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of thee
with my soul have i desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will i seek thee early for when thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness

thou hast increased the nation o lord thou hast increased the nation thou art glorified thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth
lord in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them
like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in thy sight o lord
we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen
thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead
come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast
for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain
in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea
in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine
i the lord do keep it i will water it every moment lest any hurt it i will keep it night and day
fury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle i would go through them i would burn them together
or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me and he shall make peace with me
he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit
hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him
in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind
by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged and this is all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves and images shall not stand up
yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof
when the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off the women come and set them on fire for it is a people of no understanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them and he that formed them will shew them no favour
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel
and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem
woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine
behold the lord hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the hand
the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under feet
and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up
in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people
and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate
but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean
whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts
for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little
for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people
to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear
but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken
wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule this people which is in jerusalem
because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste
judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding place
and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it
for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act
now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth
give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech
doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clods of his ground
when he hath made plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place
for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod
bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his horsemen
this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working
woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices
yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me as ariel
and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee
and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly
thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be as a dream of a night vision
it shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion
stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink
for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he covered
and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed
and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned
wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men
therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid
woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us
surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay for shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding
is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness
the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel
for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off
that make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought
therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale
but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel
they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrine
woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin
that walk to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion
for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes
they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach
the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit them
for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sit still
now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever
that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord
which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits
get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant
and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pit
for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not
but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift
one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on an hill
and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him
for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee
and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee hence
then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures
the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan
and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound
behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of indignation and his tongue as a devouring fire
and his breath as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people causing them to err
ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel
and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstones
for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rod
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with it
for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it
woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord
yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity
now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail together
for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof
as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it
turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sin
then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfited
and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is in zion and his furnace in jerusalem
behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly
the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountiful
for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail
the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh right
but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things shall he stand
rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speech
many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come
tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins
they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city
because the palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses a pasture of flocks
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the wilderness be a fruitful field and the fruitful field be counted for a forest
then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful field
and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever
and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places
when it shall hail coming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low place
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass
woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee
o lord be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou their arm every morning our salvation also in the time of trouble
at the noise of the tumult the people fled at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them
the lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his treasure
behold their valiant ones shall cry without the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly
the highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth he hath broken the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth no man
the earth mourneth and languisheth lebanon is ashamed and hewn down sharon is like a wilderness and bashan and carmel shake off their fruits
now will i rise saith the lord now will i be exalted now will i lift up myself
ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your breath as fire shall devour you
and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire
hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might
the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings
he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of oppressions that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil
he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his waters shall be sure
thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off
thine heart shall meditate terror where is the scribe where is the receiver where is he that counted the towers
thou shalt not see a fierce people a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand
look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken
but there the glorious lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither shall gallant ship pass thereby
for the lord is our judge the lord is our lawgiver the lord is our king he will save us
thy tacklings are loosed they could not well strengthen their mast they could not spread the sail then is the prey of a great spoil divided the lame take the prey
and the inhabitant shall not say i am sick the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity
come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that come forth of it
for the indignation of the lord is upon all nations and his fury upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughter
their slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up out of their carcases and the mountains shall be melted with their blood
and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the fig tree
for my sword shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come down upon idumea and upon the people of my curse to judgment
the sword of the lord is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of idumea
and the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust made fat with fatness
for it is the day of the lord's vengeance and the year of recompences for the controversy of zion
and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitch
it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none shall pass through it for ever and ever
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing
and thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owls
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest
there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered every one with her mate
seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them
and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell therein
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose
it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god
strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees
say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence he will come and save you
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped
then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert
and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes
and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein
no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there
and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah and took them
and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field
then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiah's son which was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah asaph's son the recorder
and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest
i say sayest thou but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me
lo thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him
but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar
now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen
and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy it
then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall
but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you
then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria
thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern
until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards
beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria
where are the gods of hamath and arphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand
who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand
but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the king's commandment was saying answer him not
then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh
and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord
and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth
it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me
behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land
so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish
and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying
thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria
behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in telassar
where is the king of hamath and the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and ivah
and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord
and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying
o lord of hosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth
incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the living god
of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries
and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them
now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only
then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria
this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel
by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel
i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places
hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps
therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown up
but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest
and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it
by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake
then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses
so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh
and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live
then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the lord
and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying
go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken
behold i will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down
the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness
i said in the cutting off of my days i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of the residue of my years
i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world
mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me
i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me
like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed undertake for me
what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul
o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live
behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back
for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth
the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth
the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord
for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover
hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord
at that time merodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered
and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon
then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them
then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts
behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon
then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days
comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god
speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the lord's hand double for all her sins
the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god
every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain
and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field
the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass
the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever
o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god
behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young
who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance
who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counsellor hath taught him
with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding
behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing
and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering
all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity
to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him
the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved
have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in
that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity
yea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble
to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the holy one
lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth
why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god
hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding
he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength
even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall
but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
keep silence before me o islands and let the people renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgment
who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow
he pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had not gone with his feet
who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning i the lord the first and with the last i am he
the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and came
they helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his brother be of good courage
so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying it is ready for the sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved
but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend
thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away
fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness
behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee shall perish
thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought
for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee
fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel
behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff
thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and shalt glory in the holy one of israel
when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them
i will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water
i will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and the myrtle and the oil tree i will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree together
that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the lord hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it
produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob
let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come
shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together
behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an abomination is he that chooseth you
i have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay
who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say he is righteous yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your words
the first shall say to zion behold behold them and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings
for i beheld and there was no man even among them and there was no counsellor that when i asked of them could answer a word
behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusion
behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles
he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street
a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law
thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein
i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles
to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house
i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images
behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains
let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands
the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemies
i have long time holden my peace i have been still and refrained myself now will i cry like a travailing woman i will destroy and devour at once
i will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and i will make the rivers islands and i will dry up the pools
and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do unto them and not forsake them
they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images ye are our gods
hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see
who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i sent who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lord's servant
seeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth not
the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable
but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore
who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come
who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to the robbers did not the lord he against whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law
therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart
but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine
when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee
since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life
fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west
i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth
even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him
bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears
let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth
ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour
i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god
yea before the day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it
thus saith the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the chaldeans whose cry is in the ships
i am the lord your holy one the creator of israel your king
thus saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters
which bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as tow
remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old
behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert
the beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen
this people have i formed for myself they shall shew forth my praise
but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices i have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incense
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities
i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins
put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justified
thy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against me
therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have given jacob to the curse and israel to reproaches
yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen
thus saith the lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jesurun whom i have chosen
for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring
and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses
one shall say i am the lord's and another shall call himself by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord and surname himself by the name of israel
thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god
and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them
fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any
they that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamed
who hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing
behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together
the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faint
the carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the house
he heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it
then shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down thereto
he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire
and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god
they have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand
and none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stock of a tree
he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand
remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me
i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee
sing o ye heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob and glorified himself in israel
thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself
that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish
that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will raise up the decayed places thereof
that saith to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers
that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid
thus saith the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut
i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron
and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel
for jacob my servant's sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me
i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me
that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else
i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things
drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together i the lord have created it
woe unto him that striveth with his maker let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou or thy work he hath no hands
woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou brought forth
thus saith the lord the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me
i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i commanded
i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee saying surely god is in thee and there is none else there is no god
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour
they shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols
but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end
for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is none else
i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i the lord speak righteousness i declare things that are right
assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save
tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me
look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else
i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear
surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed
in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory
bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a burden to the weary beast
they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity
hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the house of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are carried from the womb
and even to your old age i am he and even to hoar hairs will i carry you i have made and i will bear even i will carry and will deliver you
to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like
they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worship
they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble
remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors
remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me
declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure
calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken it i will also bring it to pass i have purposed it i will also do it
hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousness
i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory
come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground there is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate
take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers
thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man
as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one of israel
sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms
i was wroth with my people i have polluted mine inheritance and given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke
and thou saidst i shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end of it
therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart i am and none else beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children
but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments
for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said none seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thine heart i am and none else beside me
therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt not know
stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail
thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee
behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee
hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah which swear by the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness
for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name
i have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and i shewed them i did them suddenly and they came to pass
because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass
i have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass i shewed it thee lest thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them
thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it i have shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know them
they are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them
yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that time that thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb
for my name's sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off
behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction
for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another
hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am the first i also am the last
mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spanned the heavens when i call unto them they stand up together
all ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldeans
i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous
come ye near unto me hear ye this i have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am i and now the lord god and his spirit hath sent me
thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go
o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea
thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me
go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out
there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked
listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the lord hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me
and said unto me thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified
then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god
and now saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength
and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth
thus saith the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the lord that is faithful and the holy one of israel and he shall choose thee
thus saith the lord in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages
that thou mayest say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness shew yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places
they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide them
and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exalted
behold these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of sinim
sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted
but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me
can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee
behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me
thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee
lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth
for thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away
the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other shall say again in thine ears the place is too strait for me give place to me that i may dwell
then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these seeing i have lost my children and am desolate a captive and removing to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left alone these where had they been
thus saith the lord god behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders
and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am the lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me
shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive delivered
but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children
and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob
thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mother's divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away
wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because there is no water and dieth for thirst
i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering
the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned
the lord god hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious neither turned away back
i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting
for the lord god will help me therefore shall i not be confounded therefore have i set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be ashamed
he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to me
behold the lord god will help me who is he that shall condemn me lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them up
who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god
behold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled this shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in sorrow
hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged
look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased him
for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody
hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me o my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people
my righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine arm shall they trust
lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolished
hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generation
awake awake put on strength o arm of the lord awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old art thou not it that hath cut rahab and wounded the dragon
art thou not it which hath dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over
therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away
i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shall be made as grass
and forgettest the lord thy maker that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor
the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should fail
but i am the lord thy god that divided the sea whose waves roared the lord of hosts is his name
and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people
awake awake stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them out
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up
these two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by whom shall i comfort thee
thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god
therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not with wine
thus saith thy lord the lord and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou shalt no more drink it again
but i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over
awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion
for thus saith the lord ye have sold yourselves for nought and ye shall be redeemed without money
for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause
now therefore what have i here saith the lord that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed
therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i
how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth
thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion
break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem
the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our god
depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the vessels of the lord
for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward
behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high
as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men
so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider
who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him
he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not
surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted
but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed
all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth
he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken
and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth
yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand
he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities
therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors
sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord
enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited
fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more
for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called
for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy god
for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee
in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer
for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee
for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the lord that hath mercy on thee
o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphires
and i will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stones
and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children
in righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee
behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake
behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy
no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord
ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price
wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness
incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david
behold i have given him for a witness to the people a leader and commander to the people
behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee
seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near
let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon
for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord
for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it
for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands
instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off
thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed
blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil
neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree
for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant
even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off
also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant
even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people
the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him
all ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in the forest
his watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber
yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter
come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant
the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come
he shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each one walking in his uprightness
but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the whore
against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood
enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks
among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered a meat offering should i receive comfort in these
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice
behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it
and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase thyself even unto hell
thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou wast not grieved
and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not
i will declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit thee
when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain
and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people
for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones
for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made
for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart
i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners
i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him
but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt
there is no peace saith my god to the wicked
cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins
yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to god
wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours
behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high
is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord
is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke
is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh
then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward
then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noon day
and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not
and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in
if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
behold the lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear
but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear
for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness
none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity
they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper
their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands
their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths
the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace
therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness
we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men
we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us
for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them
in transgressing and lying against the lord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood
and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter
yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment
and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak
according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompence
so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him
and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord
as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the lord from henceforth and for ever
arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee
for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee
and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising
lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side
then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee
the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of midian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord
all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory
who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windows
surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy one of israel because he hath glorified thee
and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in my favour have i had mercy on thee
therefore thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles and that their kings may be brought
for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted
the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious
the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel
whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many generations
thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles and shalt suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob
for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron i will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness
violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise
the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory
thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended
thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified
a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time
the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn
to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified
and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers
but ye shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you the ministers of our god ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves
for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them
for i the lord love judgment i hate robbery for burnt offering and i will direct their work in truth and i will make an everlasting covenant with them
and their seed shall be known among the gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the lord hath blessed
i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels
for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations
for zion's sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth
and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name
thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god
thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzibah and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married
for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee
i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence
and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth
the lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou hast laboured
but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness
go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people
behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him
and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken
who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat
i have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread them in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment
for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come
and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my fury it upheld me
and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make them drunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth
i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praises of the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses
for he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their saviour
in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old
but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them
then he remembered the days of old moses and his people saying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within him
that led them by the right hand of moses with his glorious arm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlasting name
that led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness that they should not stumble
as a beast goeth down into the valley the spirit of the lord caused him to rest so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name
look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are they restrained
doubtless thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o lord art our father our redeemer thy name is from everlasting
o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritance
the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary
we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy name
oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come down that the mountains might flow down at thy presence
as when the melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to make thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at thy presence
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him
thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved
but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away
and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquities
but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand
be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity for ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people
thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wilderness jerusalem a desolation
our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid waste
wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore
i am sought of them that asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name
i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts
a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick
which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat swine's flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels
which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the day
behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but will recompense even recompense into their bosom
your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the lord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into their bosom
thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all
and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there
and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me
but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that number
therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when i spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did choose that wherein i delighted not
therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamed
behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the lord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes
for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy
and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying
there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed
and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them
they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands
they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them
and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord
thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest
for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word
he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dog's neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swine's blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations
i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which i delighted not
hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my name's sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed
a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies
before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child
who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children
shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy god
rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her
that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory
for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her knees
as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem
and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies
for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire
for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many
they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swine's flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord
for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my glory
and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles
and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the lord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord
and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saith the lord
for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain
and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord
and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh
the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin
to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his reign
it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month
then the word of the lord came unto me saying
before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child
but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak
be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord
then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth
see i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah what seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almond tree
then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen for i will hasten my word to perform it
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the north
then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land
for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of judah
and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own hands
thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that i command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest i confound thee before them
for behold i have made thee this day a defenced city and an iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land
and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee
moreover the word of the lord came to me saying
go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown
israel was holiness unto the lord and the firstfruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them saith the lord
hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all the families of the house of israel
thus saith the lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain
neither said they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land of egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt
and i brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made mine heritage an abomination
the priests said not where is the lord and they that handle the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by baal and walked after things that do not profit
wherefore i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with your children's children will i plead
for pass over the isles of chittim and see and send unto kedar and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing
hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit
be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate saith the lord
for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water
is israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled
the young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made his land waste his cities are burned without inhabitant
also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head
hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god when he led thee by the way
and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the waters of sihor or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink the waters of the river
thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord god of hosts
for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and thou saidst i will not transgress when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlot
yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me
for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god
how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not gone after baalim see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways
a wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasion who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find her
withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst but thou saidst there is no hope no for i have loved strangers and after them will i go
as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets
saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us
but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah
wherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed against me saith the lord
in vain have i smitten your children they received no correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion
o generation see ye the word of the lord have i been a wilderness unto israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people we are lords we will come no more unto thee
can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number
why trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways
also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents i have not found it by secret search but upon all these
yet thou sayest because i am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me behold i will plead with thee because thou sayest i have not sinned
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shalt be ashamed of egypt as thou wast ashamed of assyria
yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thine head for the lord hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt not prosper in them
they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man's shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the lord
lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hast not been lien with in the ways hast thou sat for them as the arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness
therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain and thou hadst a whore's forehead thou refusedst to be ashamed
wilt thou not from this time cry unto me my father thou art the guide of my youth
will he reserve his anger for ever will he keep it to the end behold thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest
the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot
and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it
and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocks
and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the lord
and the lord said unto me the backsliding israel hath justified herself more than treacherous judah
go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return thou backsliding israel saith the lord and i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i will not keep anger for ever
only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the lord
turn o backsliding children saith the lord for i am married unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion
and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding
and it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more the ark of the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall that be done any more
at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart
in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers
but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations and i said thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from me
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the lord
a voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplications of the children of israel for they have perverted their way and they have forgotten the lord their god
return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from the multitude of mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel
for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
we lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us for we have sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the lord our god
if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shalt thou not remove
and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory
for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns
circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings
declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow ye the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say assemble yourselves and let us go into the defenced cities
set up the standard toward zion retire stay not for i will bring evil from the north and a great destruction
the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant
for this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us
and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder
then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul
at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse
even a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence against them
behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we are spoiled
o jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim
make ye mention to the nations behold publish against jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of judah
as keepers of a field are they against her round about because she hath been rebellious against me saith the lord
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto thine heart
my bowels my bowels i am pained at my very heart my heart maketh a noise in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war
destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment
how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet
for my people is foolish they have not known me they are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge
i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light
i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly
i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled
i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and by his fierce anger
for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate yet will i not make a full end
for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repent neither will i turn back from it
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein
and when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life
for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her hands saying woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of murderers
run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i will pardon it
and though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely
o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return
therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god
i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds
wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased
how shall i pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots houses
they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbour's wife
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
go ye up upon her walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her battlements for they are not the lord's
for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the lord
they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine
and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them
wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye speak this word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood and it shall devour them
lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israel saith the lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what they say
their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty men
and they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the sword
nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not make a full end with you
and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore doeth the lord our god all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours
declare this in the house of jacob and publish it in judah saying
hear now this o foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not
fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it
but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone
neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his season he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest
your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good things from you
for among my people are found wicked men they lay wait as he that setteth snares they set a trap they catch men
as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxen rich
they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land
the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof
o ye children of benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire in bethhaccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and great destruction
i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate woman
the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shall pitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every one in his place
prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon woe unto us for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening are stretched out
arise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palaces
for thus hath the lord of hosts said hew ye down trees and cast a mount against jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is wholly oppression in the midst of her
as a fountain casteth out her waters so she casteth out her wickedness violence and spoil is heard in her before me continually is grief and wounds
be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee lest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited
thus saith the lord of hosts they shall throughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets
to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold the word of the lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight in it
therefore i am full of the fury of the lord i am weary with holding in i will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the aged with him that is full of days
and their houses shall be turned unto others with their fields and wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith the lord
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they shall be cast down saith the lord
thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein
also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet but they said we will not hearken
therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what is among them
hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words nor to my law but rejected it
to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them the neighbour and his friend shall perish
thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth
they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion
we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail
go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side
o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us
i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their way
they are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they are brass and iron they are all corrupters
the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away
reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying
stand in the gate of the lord's house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place
trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these
for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour
if ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt
then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers for ever and ever
behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit
will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye know not
and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations
is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord
but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my name at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel
and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not
therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh
and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim
therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee
seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger
do they provoke me to anger saith the lord do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces
therefore thus saith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall not be quenched
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh
for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices
but this thing commanded i them saying obey my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be well unto you
but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them
yet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their neck they did worse than their fathers
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee
but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord their god nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouth
cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath
for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the lord they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it
and they have built the high places of tophet which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i commanded them not neither came it into my heart
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in tophet till there be no place
and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them away
then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall be desolate
at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves
and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts
moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return
why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to return
i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle
yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the lord
how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain
the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them
therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely
for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the lord
i will surely consume them saith the lord there shall be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade and the things that i have given them shall pass away from them
why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the defenced cities and let us be silent there for the lord our god hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the lord
we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health and behold trouble
the snorting of his horses was heard from dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein
for behold i will send serpents cockatrices among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord
when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me
behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities
the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am black astonishment hath taken hold on me
is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered
oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people
oh that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that i might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the lord
take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbour will walk with slanders
and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity
thine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt them and try them for how shall i do for the daughter of my people
their tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth his wait
shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none can pass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are gone
and i will make jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and i will make the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant
who is the wise man that may understand this and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that none passeth through
and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked therein
but have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink
i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor their fathers have known and i will send a sword after them till i have consumed them
thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that they may come
and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters
for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we spoiled we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our dwellings have cast us out
yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation
for death is come up into our windows and is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from the streets
speak thus saith the lord even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman and none shall gather them
thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches
but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised
egypt and judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that are in the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart
hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of israel
thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them
for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe
they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not
they are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good
forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou art great and thy name is great in might
who would not fear thee o king of nations for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee
but they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is a doctrine of vanities
silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men
but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation
thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens
he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion
when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures
every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them
they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name
gather up thy wares out of the land o inhabitant of the fortress
for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them that they may find it so
woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said truly this is a grief and i must bear it
my tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains
for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the lord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scattered
behold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate and a den of dragons
o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps
o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing
pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitation desolate
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying
hear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem
and say thou unto them thus saith the lord god of israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant
which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnace saying obey my voice and do them according to all which i command you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god
that i may perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered i and said so be it o lord
then the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the words of this covenant and do them
for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying obey my voice
yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart therefore i will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did them not
and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers which refused to hear my words and they went after other gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me i will not hearken unto them
then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto baal
therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble
what hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest
the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken
for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal
and the lord hath given me knowledge of it and i know it then thou shewedst me their doings
but i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter and i knew not that they had devised devices against me saying let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered
but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause
therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine
and there shall be no remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation
righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously
thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins
but thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mine heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter
how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our last end
if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace wherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of jordan
for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto thee
i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies
mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out against me therefore have i hated it
mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field come to devour
many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness
they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heart
the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace
they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord
thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit behold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of judah from among them
and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them out i will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his land
and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people
but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the lord
thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water
so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it on my loins
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying
take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and arise go to euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock
so i went and hid it by euphrates as the lord commanded me
and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me arise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there
then i went to euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing
then the word of the lord came unto me saying
thus saith the lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem
this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing
for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear
therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith the lord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine
then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon david's throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness
and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them
hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken
give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness
but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because the lord's flock is carried away captive
say unto the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit down for your principalities shall come down even the crown of your glory
the cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall open them judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall be wholly carried away captive
lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail
and if thou say in thine heart wherefore come these things upon me for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare
can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil
therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness
this is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith the lord because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood
therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear
i have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields woe unto thee o jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it once be
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the dearth
judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are black unto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters they came to the pits and found no water they returned with their vessels empty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads
because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth the plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads
yea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it because there was no grass
and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up the wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was no grass
o lord though our iniquities testify against us do thou it for thy name's sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee
o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night
why shouldest thou be as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lord art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not
thus saith the lord unto this people thus have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord doth not accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins
then said the lord unto me pray not for this people for their good
when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence
then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will give you assured peace in this place
then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow
if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sick with famine yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not
hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul lothed zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold trouble
we acknowledge o lord our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee
do not abhor us for thy name's sake do not disgrace the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us
are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord our god therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these things
then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth
and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the captivity to the captivity
and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord the sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy
and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that which he did in jerusalem
for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shall bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest
thou hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am weary with repenting
and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i will bereave them of children i will destroy my people since they return not from their ways
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors upon the city
she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies saith the lord
woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth i have neither lent on usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth curse me
the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction
shall iron break the northern iron and the steel
thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders
and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which shall burn upon you
o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that for thy sake i have suffered rebuke
thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of hosts
i sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced i sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation
why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail
therefore thus saith the lord if thou return then will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them
and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the lord
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible
the word of the lord came also unto me saying
thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place
for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land
they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth
for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament nor bemoan them for i have taken away my peace from this people saith the lord even lovingkindness and mercies
both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother
thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god
then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my law
and ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto me
therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where i will not shew you favour
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt
but the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers
behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and they shall fish them and after will i send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks
for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes
and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things
o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no profit
shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods
therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord
the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart and upon the horns of your altars
whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills
o my mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout all thy borders
and thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage that i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever
thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord
for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited
blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is
for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit
the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings
as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and at his end shall be a fool
a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary
o lord the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters
heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be saved for thou art my praise
behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord let it come now
as for me i have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest that which came out of my lips was right before thee
be not a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of evil
let them be confounded that persecute me but let not me be confounded let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction
thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by the which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem
and say unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and all judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these gates
thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i commanded your fathers
but they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but made their neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction
and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever
and they shall come from the cities of judah and from the places about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the plain and from the mountains and from the south bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense and bringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the lord
but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched
the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
arise and go down to the potter's house and there i will cause thee to hear my words
then i went down to the potter's house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it
then the word of the lord came to me saying
o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay is in the potter's hand so are ye in mine hand o house of israel
at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it
if that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them
and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it
if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good wherewith i said i would benefit them
now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good
and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart
therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing
will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken
because my people hath forgotten me they have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast up
to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head
i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their calamity
then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words
give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me
shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them
therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death let their young men be slain by the sword in battle
let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet
yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the time of thine anger
thus saith the lord go and get a potter's earthen bottle and take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priests
and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee
and say hear ye the word of the lord o kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place the which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle
because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents
they have built also the high places of baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baal which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter
and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their carcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth
and i will make this city desolate and an hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof
and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straiten them
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee
and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh a potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury them in tophet till there be no place to bury
thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet
and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall be defiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods
then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the lord's house and said to all the people
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it because they have hardened their necks that they might not hear my words
now pashur the son of immer the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesied these things
then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of benjamin which was by the house of the lord
and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath not called thy name pashur but magormissabib
for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword
moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to babylon
and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies
o lord thou hast deceived me and i was deceived thou art stronger than i and hast prevailed i am in derision daily every one mocketh me
for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoil because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily
then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay
for i heard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and we will report it all my familiars watched for my halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him
but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten
but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i opened my cause
sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers
cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed
cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a man child is born unto thee making him very glad
and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew and repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontide
because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with me
wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying
enquire i pray thee of the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us if so be that the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us
then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah
thus saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you without the walls and i will assemble them into the midst of this city
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath
and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence
and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy
and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey
for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire
and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye the word of the lord
o house of david thus saith the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings
behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations
but i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things round about it
thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word
and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates
thus saith the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place
for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people
but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith the lord that this house shall become a desolation
for thus saith the lord unto the king's house of judah thou art gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee a wilderness and cities which are not inhabited
and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire
and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city
then they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other gods and served them
weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country
for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more
but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no more
woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that useth his neighbour's service without wages and giveth him not for his work
that saith i will build me a wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is cieled with cedar and painted with vermilion
shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him
he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me saith the lord
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it
therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ah lord or ah his glory
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem
go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed
i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not hear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not my voice
the wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness
o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travail
as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence
and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans
and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die
but to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not return
is this man coniah a despised broken idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know not
o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah
woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the lord
and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increase
and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth
in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt
but the lord liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all countries whither i had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of the lord and because of the words of his holiness
for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right
for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith the lord
wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err
i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the hands of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land
thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord
they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you
for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath perceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it
behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury even a grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked
the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly
i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied
but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings
am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off
can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord
i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal
the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff to the wheat saith the lord
is not my word like as a fire saith the lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces
therefore behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every one from his neighbour
behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use their tongues and say he saith
behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all saith the lord
and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto them what burden i will even forsake you saith the lord
and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken
and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more for every man's word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god
thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered thee and what hath the lord spoken
but since ye say the burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say this word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying ye shall not say the burden of the lord
therefore behold i even i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the city that i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten
the lord shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths from jerusalem and had brought them to babylon
one basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be eaten they were so bad
then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i said figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that cannot be eaten they are so evil
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good
for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up
and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart
and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil surely thus saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt
and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them
and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying
from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day that is the three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened
and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear
they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever
and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and i will do you no hurt
yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words
behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual desolations
moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle
and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years
and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations
and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands
for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send thee to drink it
and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the sword that i will send among them
then took i the cup at the lord's hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the lord had sent me
to wit jerusalem and the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation an astonishment an hissing and a curse as it is this day
pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people
and all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and azzah and ekron and the remnant of ashdod
edom and moab and the children of ammon
and all the kings of tyrus and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea
dedan and tema and buz and all that are in the utmost corners
and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert
and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes
and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of sheshach shall drink after them
therefore thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spue and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you
and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye shall certainly drink
for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the lord of hosts
therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he shall mightily roar upon his habitation he shall give a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth
a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth
and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the ground
howl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escape
a voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard for the lord hath spoiled their pasture
and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord
he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord saying
thus saith the lord stand in the court of the lord's house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in the lord's house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word
if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings
and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened
then will i make this house like shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth
so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord
now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou shalt surely die
why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying this house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord
when the princes of judah heard these things then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the lord and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lord's house
then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears
then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard
therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you
as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you
but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god
then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying
micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest
did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus might we procure great evil against our souls
and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah
and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt
and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt
and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people
nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying
thus saith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck
and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to the king of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah
and command them to say unto their masters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters
i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me
and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him
and all nations shall serve him and his son and his son's son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him
and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand
therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon
for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish
but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein
i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live
why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon
therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy a lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you
also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lord's house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste
but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city
which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem
yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem
they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them saith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to this place
and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon
within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lord's house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon
and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord
even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lord's house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence
the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him
then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah's neck and brake it
and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way
then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying
go and tell hananiah saying thus saith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also
then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord
so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month
now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon
after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the eunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from jerusalem
by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon
build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them
take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished
and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord
for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place
for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end
then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you
and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart
and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive
because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon
know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in this city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil
and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them
because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord
hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire
because they have committed villany in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which i have not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith the lord
thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying
the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks
now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth which maketh himself a prophet to you
for therefore he sent unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people saith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying
thus speaketh the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book
for lo the days come saith the lord that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it
and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah
for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace
ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness
alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it
for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him
but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them
therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid
for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished
for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable and thy wound is grievous
there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicines
all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased
why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased i have done these things unto thee
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey
for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast saying this is zion whom no man seeketh after
thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity of jacob's tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the city shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof
and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be few i will also glorify them and they shall not be small
their children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all that oppress them
and their nobles shall be of themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me saith the lord
and ye shall be my people and i will be your god
behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury a continuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked
the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he have done it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it
at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people
thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest
the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee
again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry
thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things
for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god
for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o lord save thy people the remnant of israel
behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them from the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thither
they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn
hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock
for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he
therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow
and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord
thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah lamentation and bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not
thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy
and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border
i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus thou hast chastised me and i was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord my god
surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth
is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since i spake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith the lord
set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again o virgin of israel turn again to these thy cities
how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass a man
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof when i shall bring again their captivity the lord bless thee o habitation of justice and mountain of holiness
and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks
for i have satiated the weary soul and i have replenished every sorrowful soul
upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me
behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast
and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith the lord
in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children's teeth are set on edge
but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge
behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord
but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people
and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name
if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever
thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb and shall compass about to goath
and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar
for then the king of babylon's army besieged jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judah's house
for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it
and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes
and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fight with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper
and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying
behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it
so hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord
and i bought the field of hanameel my uncle's son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver
and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances
so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open
and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison
and i charged baruch before them saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land
now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying
ah lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name
great in counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel and among other men and hast made thee a name as at this day
and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terror
and hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey
and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them
behold the mounts they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it
and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for money and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing too hard for me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it
and the chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set fire on this city and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto baal and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke me to anger
for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done evil before me from their youth for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith the lord
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that i should remove it from before my face
because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem
and they have turned unto me the back and not the face though i taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it
and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin
and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence
behold i will gather them out of all countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely
and they shall be my people and i will be their god
and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them
and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me
yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul
for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them
and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans
men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the lord
moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying
thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name
call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not
for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword
they come to fight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city
behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first
and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me
and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it
thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down
in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah
in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land
in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness
for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel
neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually
and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their season
then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites the priests my ministers
as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me
moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation before them
thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth
then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon
yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword
but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the word saith the lord
then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem
when the king of babylon's army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah
this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them
that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a jew his brother
now when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go
but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids
therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear
and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name
but ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids
therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof
the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calf
i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth
and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylon's army which are gone up from you
behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying
go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink
then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites
and i brought them into the house of the lord into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door
and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine
but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever
neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers
thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters
nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed
but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us
but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at jerusalem
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith the lord
the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink none but obey their father's commandment notwithstanding i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto me
i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me
because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me
therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered
and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever
and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying
take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day
it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin
then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book
and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of the lord
therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lord's house upon the fasting day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities
it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people
and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord in the lord's house
and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem
then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lord's house in the ears of all the people
when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the lord
then he went down into the king's house into the scribe's chamber and lo all the princes sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes
then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people
therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them
and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears so baruch read it in their ears
now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these words
and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth
then baruch answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book
then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye be
and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the king
so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of elishama the scribe's chamber and jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king
now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him
and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth
yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words
nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear them
but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them
then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah saying
take thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned
and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast
therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost
and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they hearkened not
then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like words
and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah
but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah
and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying pray now unto the lord our god for us
now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prison
then pharaoh's army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed from jerusalem
then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold pharaoh's army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land
and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire
thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire
and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh's army
then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the people
and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans
then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans but he hearkened not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him to the princes
wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison
when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins and jeremiah had remained there many days
then zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon
moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison
where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land
therefore hear now i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there
then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city were spent thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying
thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live
thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylon's army which shall take it
therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt
then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you
then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire
now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin
ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house and spake to the king saying
my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city
then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die
so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah
and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords and jeremiah did so
so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me
then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto me
so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life
then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon's princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon's princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand
and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me
but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live
but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath shewed me
and behold all the women that are left in the king of judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of babylon's princes and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire
then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die
but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee
then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathan's house to die there
then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived
so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken
in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besieged it
and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month the city was broken up
and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middle gate even nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsaris nergalsharezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon
and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the king's garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain
but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him
then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah
moreover he put out zedekiah's eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to babylon
and the chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remained
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people which had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying
take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylon's princes
even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people
now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying
go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee
but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid
for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the lord
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of jerusalem and judah which were carried away captive unto babylon
and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place
now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you
and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go thither go
now while he was not yet gone back he said go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go
then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land
now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon
then they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men
and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you
as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken
likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the ammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan
even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very much
moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah
and said unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not
then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in judah perish
but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael
now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes of the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah
then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land
ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and the men of war
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it
that there came certain from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the lord
and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam
and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him
but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren
now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain
then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the king's daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the ammonites
but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done
then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon
now it came to pass that when all the people which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad
so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the ammonites
then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from gibeon
and they departed and dwelt in the habitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt
because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land
then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near
and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us
that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do
then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you
then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us
whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the lord our god
and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah
then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces which were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest
and said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him
if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you
be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand
and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land
but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the lord your god
saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell
and now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there
then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye shall die
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more
the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day
for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it
and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn
and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god for which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words
